# Component: `<PlanCourseTab>`

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

Provides an interactive tab where users can search for courses by code, add them to a personal plan, and view them in a dedicated table. Utilizes localStorage for persistence across sessions.

---

## ðŸ”§ Internal State

| State Variable      | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `searchQuery`       | Input for searching course code |
| `searchResults`     | Results returned from course search |
| `addedCourses`      | Courses added to the plan (stored in localStorage) |
| `requirements`      | Requirements used for formatting the course table |
| `toast`             | Snackbar message state for success/warnings |
| `showSearchResults` | Toggles visibility of search result panel |
| `compactViewMode`   | Controls how requirement paths are displayed |
| `loading`           | Whether requirement data is being fetched |

---

## ðŸ§  Logic Overview

- Uses `localStorage` to persist added courses
- Fetches requirement data from backend to support table rendering
- Enables searching by formatted course code (e.g., `15122` or `15-122`)
- Displays toast messages when adding duplicate or new courses
- Filters out already added courses from re-adding
- Supports compact requirement views (`full`, `last2`, `last1`)
- Provides a search dropdown UI that collapses on outside click

---

## ðŸ“¤ Example Usage

```jsx
<PlanCourseTab />
```

Used as a standalone tab or page in the GenEd planning interface. Requires the backend to expose:
- `/courses/search`
- `/courses/{course_code}`
- `/requirements`

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

| Class | Description |

| `scrollable-results` | Floating container for search matches |

| `toast-snackbar` | Feedback messages |
| `loading-spinner` | Loading indicator |
| `view-toggle`, `clear-all-btn` | Utility controls for view and clearing plan |

## ðŸš¨ Notes

- Integrates with `CourseTable`, so format consistency and filtering logic are shared.
- Can be easily extended to allow editing/removal or viewing course details.
- This component only adds courses via search; it does not support filtering by requirements or location.
