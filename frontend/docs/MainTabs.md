# Component: `<MainTabs>`

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

Serves as the entry-point navigation for the GenEd planning interface. Manages the three main tabs: **View**, **Plan**, and **Analytics**, and renders their associated components. Uses `localStorage` to persist the userâ€™s last selected tab.

## ðŸ”§ Internal State

| State Variable | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `activeTab`    | Stores the currently selected tab: `"general"`, `"plan"`, or `"analytics"` |

## ðŸ§  Logic Overview

- `useEffect` stores the selected tab in `localStorage` to persist tab selection across page reloads
- Renders one of the three tab components conditionally:
  - `"general"` â†’ `<CourseTablePage />`
  - `"plan"` â†’ `<PlanCourseTab />`
  - `"analytics"` â†’ `<AnalyticsPage />`
- Applies the `"active"` class to the selected tab for styling

## ðŸ“¤ Example Usage

```jsx
<MainTabs />
```

Used as the main controller in the appâ€™s homepage or dashboard to switch between course viewing, planning, and analytics.
