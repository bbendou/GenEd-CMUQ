## ðŸš¨ Notes

- Requires backend support at:  
  `GET /analytics/enrollment-data?course_code=XX-XXX`
- Automatically deduplicates courses and applies semantic formatting (`15-122`)
- Enrollment traces use `lines+markers` for visual clarity
- Class-specific analytics excludes "Class 0" (unspecified or administrative entries)
