While these are more recent manifestations, gender and sexuality have always played a critical role in an understanding of the Spanishspeaking world. In this course, we will explore how gender, understood as a social construct, and sexuality are inextricably linked to economic and political structures, and importantly, how gender and sexuality intersect with race and class in the very diverse cultures of the Spanishspeaking world. The course is conducted in English but students with knowledge of Spanish will have an opportunity to use their language skills.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RU2iXs7Vyc-6F-HRozPu7_YdV7oYuOGn/view", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1.
