"long_desc": "This course takes the perspective of the consultant whose job is to analyze existing or potential business processes and provide recommendations for managerial decisionmaking. Recognizing that most businesses are subject to high levels of variability, risk and uncertainty, it will adopt a stochastic approach to characterize the behavior of business systems and processes, and explore the effects of alternative decisions in this context.  Two modeling methodologies will be covered i stochastic modeling, and ii stochastic simulation. Examples are drawn from different managerial domains, such as supply chain management, risk management, marketing, and project management. The lectures, homework assignments, exam and term project will focus on modeling, computational, and analytical skills. Computational implementations will be done in Excel using the Risk addin during the first half of the course to build simple simulation models and the Arena software during the second half of the course to build more complex models based on discreteevent simulation.    This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.   If so, the thirdparty course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the thirdparty course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the Universitys cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from 13 to 75.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Managerial ", "slug": "managerial", "id": 862}], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "After completing the course students should acquire the following skillsModel uncertainty and risk quantitatively using probabilistic tools.Develop computational models for managerial simulation using appropriate software.Generate probabilistic distributions for outputs e.g., profit, waiting time, etc. and relevant performance metrics e.g., average, standard deviation, distribution tails.Communicate outputs of uncertainty analyses and implications for managerial decisions.", "key_topics": "The course will focus on why uncertainty matters, and provide stochastic modeling and simulation tools to characterize risk and assess alternative decisions.
