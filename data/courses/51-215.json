The primary software for this course is Adobe Photoshop, with which students will explore construction, combination, manipulation, input, and output of video as a means of narrative creation. This Micro course will run between 56 weeks. The instructor will fly into Doha for a short period of facetoface classes, centered around a Saturday. Enrolled students should expect two 90minute facetoface classes during the week before or after this Saturday date, as well as four 90minute evening 6730 pm video classes over the duration of the Micro course typically two before the campus visit, and two after, although instructors can change this.
