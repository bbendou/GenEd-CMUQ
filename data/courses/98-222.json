Even though this is a StuCo, we still go fairly indepth to the many facets of basic iOS design. Therefore, expect this course to be more timeintensive than a traditional StuCo. You should expect weekly homework assignments in the first half of the semester and a midterm and final project in the second half of the semester. It is also highly recommended that you have some experience with objectoriented programming. 15122 and 15150 are recommended prerequisites, but 15112 is okay too. You will either need a Mac running the latest version of Mac OS X or access to one of the Mac clusters on campus.
