These initiatives may range from localized AI applications to large-scale infrastructure projects. By capturing the imagination of researchers and system builders, we aim to foster groundbreaking solutions.\nRaj Reddy's Vision: We revisit the visionary perspective laid out by Turing Award winner and Moza Bint Nasser University Professor at CMU, Dr. Raj Reddy, in his 1988 Presidential address to the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. Dr. Reddy's insights serve as a guiding light as we assess progress over the past three decades.\nChallenge Goals: While some AI milestones, such as world-champion chess machines, were achieved swiftly, others\u00bflike self-replicating systems\u00bfdemand sustained effort and breakthroughs. We critically evaluate the progress made and identify areas where further focus is needed.\nNew Decade, New Challenges: As we step into the current decade, we propose a fresh set of challenges. These challenges span three critical spheres:\nHealth: How can (Gen) AI improve healthcare access, diagnostics, and treatment outcomes in emerging economies?\nWealth: What role can AI play in economic development, job creation, and poverty alleviation?\nWisdom: How can AI enhance education, governance, and decision-making processes?\nThought Leadership: Drawing from insights shared by thought leader guest speakers, we will explore diverse viewpoints and stimulate informed discussions.\nStudent Engagement: Students actively participate in class discussions, critically evaluating progress and proposing their own challenge ideas.
