The course will involve completing a set of challenging engineering applications of AI that will include Medical applications, Video Games, Autonomous driving, Autonomous Robots, Finance and Economics, Military, Art, Advertising.  Students should have a good background in basic probability theory, maturity in mathematical topics, and good programming skills. For seniors who would like to take the course but do not have the necessary prerequisites, instructors permission will be required.  Although students in 18462 will share lectures with students in 18662, students in 18462 will receive distinct homework assignments, distinct projects, and distinct exams from the ones given to students in 18662.
