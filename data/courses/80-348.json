This course aims to introduce students to the problem of global public health and its intersection with claims of human rights.  We will focus on theoretical accounts of human rights and questions arising from them What constitutes a human right, and on what basis or bases might the existence of human rights be defended  If human rights exist, whose responsibility is it to see that they are defendedprovidednot violated, and why What is the relationship between health deficits and human rights deficits, and what would a human right to health look like  Are global institutions such as the protection of strong intellectual property rights consistent with respect for a human right to health", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Drinks", "slug": "drinks", "id": 1562}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students are expected to come away from the course with a strong understanding of human rights theory, global health inequalities, how global health inequalities are related to global institutions of trade and finance, and how to parcel out responsibility for addressing healthrelated human rights.
