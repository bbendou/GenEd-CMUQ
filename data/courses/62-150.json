To do this, they thoughtfully collaborate and critically reflect on media creation, distribution, participation, interaction, and how media affects the audience. In this course, students will challenge themselves to work in these new modal contexts by thinking critically in a genre of exploration. They will formulate the intent of their creative work, articulate relationships to artdesign practice and theory, and respond insightfully to creative, mediarich outcomes. The class will introduce core concepts through foundational texts, inclass exercises, collaborative projects, and group critique. Through handson media exploration, students will ground concepts such as embodiment, emergence, composition, participatory interfaces, and mediated experiences. Section A will be an Introduction to Textile Media. Section B will be an Introduction to Mediascapes 2D to 3D Spatial Environments. Section C will be Life in the Digital Factory Spatial Storytelling about Computational Landscapes.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": "https://ideate.cmu.edu/courses/portal-and-section-details.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Critical Thinking", "slug": "critical-thinking", "id": 63}, {"name": "Interface Engineering", "slug": "interface-engineering", "id": 826}], "attributes": [{"name": "ideate", "id": 8, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Each section of course will build foundational skills that are part of the core values of all courses in the IDeATe program critique, building narratives, reflection, collaboration.
