The anatomy and physiology of major organ systems will be studied in the context of normal and disease states. Students will learn about critical biological processes such as the central dogma, membrane diffusion and transport, cell signaling, gas exchange, blood flow, nutrient absorption, blood pH balance, and action potential generation and propagation. Students will then apply this knowledge to understand how organs respond to various inputs in maintaining homeostasis. Handson demonstrations will be incorporated to provide a practical framework for the information presented in lectures. At the culmination of the semester, students will gain a broad understanding of how the body systems function at the cellular, tissue and organ levels and be able to relate simple physiological processes to better understand highly prevalent diseases in society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to describe the relationship between structure and function for many of the organ systems of the human body, establish an intellectual framework for how different organ systems work together, apply key cellular functions to understand the cellular basis of normal organ function homeostasis and how this is altered during disease states, develop skills in critical thinking and problem solving in relation to our understanding of human structure and function, appreciate how an understanding of structure and function has led to advances in medical diagnostics, communicate their understanding of human health and disease to a peer audience.", "key_topics": "Central dogma, membrane diffusion and transport, cell signaling.
