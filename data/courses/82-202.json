Introducing vocabulary sets, core grammatical concepts through cultural texts and strategic interaction, this class will focus on developing academic literacy as well as sociopragmatic competence that is to say, what to say to whom, and how in an interculturally responsive way. To this end, we will incorporate a broad range of learning activities that emphasize a students active participation. Emphasis will be placed on developing stronger listening and oral communication skills as well as reinforcing reading ability and acquiring greater facility in written proficiency. Consequently, this syllabus is constructed to permit a fair amount of selfinstruction through the accompanying grammar reference book and selfguided exploration.  F22 The course is an exploration of French language and culture through a nesting of two experiences 1 playing and analyzing games together as a class and 2 designing games with the objectives of them being used or usable by French studentsteachers in the classroom complete with rules and pedagogical guides.   This semester, we are trying a new thing, which is to have both advanced students such as yourself and intermediatelevel students in the same class to try and form a true Community of Practice in which the students will be socialized into a mostly Frenchspeaking community of gamers and game designers.
