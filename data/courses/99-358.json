Students will learn the basics of the Unity3D engine, and to creatively and effectively build their own simple games.  This course will cover topics such as navigating and using the engine, basic game programming in C, user interface development and introductory game design principles. Students will be assessed based on the functionality of their games and will receive further feedback on their implementation, execution and creativity.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Interface Engineering", "slug": "interface-engineering", "id": 826}, {"name": "Games", "slug": "games", "id": 859}, {"name": "Game Design", "slug": "game-design", "id": 1528}], "attributes": [{"name": "ideate", "id": 8, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "maker", "id": 12, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be primed with the skills and knowledge to tackle independent projects in Unity without relying on followalong guides or existing structures.
