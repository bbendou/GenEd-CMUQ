Unlike other casino games, such as Roulette, which are purely luckbased and are a net loss for the player, Blackjack can be beaten with card counting. This is because, unlike in Roulette, each card draw in Blackjack is not an independent event. Later card draws can be predicted with results from earlier draws in the same game, which makes some room for maneuvering of probabilities to the players advantage. This course is for people who are interested in learning more about the rules  tricks of Blackjack and learning how to beat it. NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We will learn the rules of the game, memorize the basic mathematical strategy, and master the card counting skills necessary to beat the game. Each week, after some theory, we will do training drills to help everyone get better at muscle skills.
