Through reading, discussion, and graded assignments including short essays and oral presentations, we will examine the interanimating relationship of literature and history in moments of crisis. Examples of primary readings include Aphra Behns Ooronoko, selections from Miltons Paradise Lost, Jane Austens Mansfield Park, Mary Princes The History of Mary Prince, and William Wordsworths To Toussaint LOuverture. Secondary readings will draw from a variety of critical traditions such as post and decolonial studies, Black studies, poststructuralism, and material culture studies.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Understand literature of the long 18th century in relation to historical movements improve writing and oral communication develop methods for literary analysis understand historical origins of contemporary social justice movements", "key_topics": "Romanticism, long eighteenth century, literature, race, gender and sexuality", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Some knowledge of and interest in methods of literary analysis", "assessment_structure": "Oral presentations, essays, Canvas discussion, creative assignment", "relevance": "Provides an overview of the literature and culture of the long eighteenth century; offers opportunities to improve writing and critical thinking; provides training in methods for analyzing literature", "learning_resources": "Students will be asked to purchase 1-2 novels.
