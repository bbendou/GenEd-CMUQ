Topics include genre and rhetorical analysis, ethical source use, oral presentation and visual design, as well as textual structure, style, clarity, and coherence. Students will analyze conventional academic texts to familiarize themselves with features and strategies employed by communicators. This practice will enable higher comprehension while increasing confidence in their communication abilities in academic English. Class sessions will involve researchbased and corpusdriven discussion and activities to support both productive and receptive language skills. Students will transfer skills gained in genre awareness and knowledge to other academic and professional situations.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Hunting", "slug": "hunting", "id": 1000}, {"name": "Future Materials", "slug": "future-materials", "id": 1546}], "attributes": [{"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Increase genre awareness and knowledge of conventional communication practices in U.S. academic situations,Analyze genre, forum, and audience as well as characteristic features of academic discourse in English,Recognize and produce communication that fits the structures and conventions of scholarly writing and speakingGrow in confidence in their abilities to communicate with clarity and coherence in written, oral, and visual forms.", "key_topics": "written and oral communication skills, genre and corpus-driven analysis, US graduate-level communication expectations", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "class discussions, short written responses to readings, oral presentation with visual element, database research with corpus analysis, group project (toolkit creation and reflective memo)", "relevance": "Often, multilingual graduate students receive little direct instruction in communication conventions in their own programs or departments.
