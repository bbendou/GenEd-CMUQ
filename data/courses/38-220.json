Coursework requires that students attend 8 distinct arts events, 2 of which must engage with a culture different from ones personal cultural background. In choosing events, students should be imbued with an attitude of openness to new ideas and a willingness to try something new. The course requires students to share, reflect, and document their participation in a variety of arts events by engaging with classmates and instructors through MyCORE, where they can upload coursework and find postings for events.  Coursework can be completed at any time during students undergraduate years, but they must register for the class during the semester that they intend to complete it, no later than their penultimate semester.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Eventing", "slug": "eventing", "id": 1001}, {"name": "Fine Arts", "slug": "fine-arts", "id": 1358}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students should be able to demonstrate knowledge of the arts, humanities and social sciences as well as describe multiple similarities and differences between ones own culture and that of others.", "key_topics": "Broaden your knowledge of the fine arts.
