It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is particularly relevant to the current information age. We have an evergrowing wealth of data that could uncover great benefits if properly visualized. Much of the data which we generate and utilize hold geographical aspects. Demographic, health, education, environment, resource, crime, transport, economic, and development data could be effectively represented through Geographic Information Systems GIS. GIS provide the necessary tools to analyze and visualize data in order to uncover relationships that are not readily apparent. This holds a great potential for improved planning, communication, and decision making, leading to positive social and organizational implications. To harness such potential, this course introduces students to the basics of GIS through theoretical and practical sessions aimed at establishing fundamental GIS understanding and skills.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1.
