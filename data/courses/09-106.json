Based on the response we are able to clarify misconceptions. 2) Recitation lab activities: Students are taken into the lab where they work in groups to either design an experiment to answer a question posed or they perform experiments to test the theoretical concepts learnt in lecture. 3) Recitation quizzes. Students are given short answer quizzes ~ once a week to gauge their understanding of the material.,\no\tHomework. Students are proved with a homework assignment and the end of each key topic.

Purchase of the textbook is optional. Copies of the newest edition and older editions are on reserve in the Sorrells library in Wean Hall.\n-\tStudents are provided with an outline of lecture notes at the start of each lecture. Once lecture is completed, post-filled lecture notes are uploaded to Canvas\n-\tAn Online Learning Initiative (OLI) has been developed specifically for the course to offer on line tutorials of the course material. The OLI also walks students through how to do necessary calculations and a quiz is provided at the end with detail solutions so that students can self-assess.\n-\tStudents are encouraged to use Piazza (online discussion forum) to ask questions.
