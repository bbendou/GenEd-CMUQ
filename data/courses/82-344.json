This course provides an introduction to and analysis of the cultures and histories of U.S. Latinos.  The course will trace the historical trajectories of these groups, both those dating back centuries, such as MexicanAmericans and certain Caribbean populations, and those with more recent, quickly growing populations, such as Salvadoran and Honduran immigrants, in an effort to understand how their identities are forged and transformed over time, considering both internal and external perspectives.  Our exploration of U.S. Latino history and cultures will compare and contrast the experiences of people from the abovedescribed categories and analyze the dynamic tension amongst them, with other minority groups, and with the mainstream US society. We will examine a wide variety of materials, including texts, film, art, music etc. in order to gain a better understanding of Latino populations in the United States.
