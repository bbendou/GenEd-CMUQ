This course is a blend of political science and data analytics, specifically focusing on the US electoral system. It places a special emphasis on the 2024 election, as well as the upcoming midterm and local elections. History demonstrates that elections can have profound and enduring impacts. From the pivotal election of 1876, which concluded Reconstruction and reshaped the nation for a century, to the razorthin margins in the 1960 Kennedy election and the 2000 BushGore contest, American politics has been profoundly influenced by electoral outcomes.Throughout the semester, students will actively engage in data collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation. These techniques will be applied to analyze election trends, voter demographics, and the influence of technology on political campaigns. The course will also explore how data analytics can assess the health of democracy, examining metrics such as voter turnout, electoral competitiveness, and public trust in electoral institutions. As the course progresses, students will utilize analytical tools to make informed predictions about the 2026 midterm elections, which will determine all House seats and 35 Senate seats. They will delve into oddyear elections in various states and localities, gaining insights into their unique dynamics and implications. Beyond the core topics, the course will cover a diverse range of additional subjects, including political advertising, campaign finance, media bias, partisanship, nationalization, mobilization strategies, vote suppression techniques, election security, voter knowledge, racially polarized voting, gerrymandering, polarization, forecasting models, and public opinion polling.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students will be able to frame questions related to American elections, such as how do candidates emerge, why do some candidates succeed while others fail, when do elections fundamentally change the course of history, and who votes and why Students will be able to utilize diverse electoral data sources to analyze trends and patterns in American electoral behavior and outcomes.
