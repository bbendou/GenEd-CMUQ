What is the self What is the meaning of life and of death What is truth What is justice What does it mean to live a righteous life In Russia these existential quandaries fell within the purview not only of philosophers but also of the poets and prosewriters we will consider in this course. While the course roughly follows the chronology of the 19th century, it is structured around these accursed questions rather than by literary movement or genre. There are two reasons for this. First, Russias literary culture began to develop later than other traditions as a result, Russian authors of the 19th century were exposed to many different movements and often participated in several at once. Second, and relatedly, many authors worked across genres and in dialogue with philosophers, critics, novelists, and poets. They published in thick journals, composed of texts ranging from the literary to the journalistic to the academic. For these reasons, it is difficult to categorize these authors along stylistic or generic lines. As philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev observes, what united them was an abiding interest in the most profound existential questions. Students in this course will examine how an authors use of genre, affiliation with particular literary movements, and sociopolitical commitments inflected their treatment of the accursed questions. Students will become familiar with not only the cultural artifacts of this fertile century but also the circumstanceshistorical, cultural, institutionalin which these artifacts were created. They will also be encouraged to reflect on how these perennial accursed questions are articulated at present, and what that reveals about our own sociopolitical commitments and generic loyalties.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Modern History", "slug": "modern-history", "id": 1266}], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course students will be able to ...
