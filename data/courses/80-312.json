They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly. The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilbert's \"Foundations of Geometry\". When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics and is at the center of the second episode. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work. Given Turing's analysis of computations, the question \"How much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines?\" is addressed in the third part. Completing a full circle, we incorporate central features of the axiomatic method into computational models of mathematical thinking.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Some familiarity with either mathematics, logic or theoretical computer science.", "assessment_structure": "Extensive reading for all meetings, brief analytic essays concerning each of the three revolutions, class presentations about readings and one larger term paper together with a brief presentation on a topic of the student's interest.", "relevance": "Dietrich GenEd Prior to Fall 2021: Modeling - Other\nDietrich GenEd After Fall 2021: Logic / Mathematical Reasoning\n\nFor any student who studies mathematics, computer science, philosophy or cognitive psychology, the material is crucial for grasping the interdependence of these subjects.", "learning_resources": "Important primary sources and illuminating secondary literature provided by the instructor via Canvas.", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
