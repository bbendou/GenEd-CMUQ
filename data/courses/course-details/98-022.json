Students are allowed 2 absences per semester (excluding the final exam). Each class is worth about 4% of their final grade. Students will also be allowed to make-up a maximum of 2 absences if they would like by making a recipe from a cookbook of their choice asynchronously and sharing their reflections with the class.\n\nRecipe Book (20%): Each class, we will preface what we'll be making and provide students a note-taking template (like a recipe card). Students should fill out this card every lecture and turn it in before the next class. This will culminate in students having their own mini cookbooks by the end of the semester!\n\nMidterm (10%): Students will either (1) cook a recipe with someone and submit a reflection on the experience of working with someone in the kitchen or (2) find a book about food science and write a report about what they learned. We (as a class) may decide to share these as a presentation day!\n\nFinal (10%): Students will be given a list of ingredients one week in advance and challenged to design a dish (inspired by the cooking show, Chopped). They must attend class to create their dish (makeups will only be granted on a case-by-case basis).", "relevance": "Very relevant!
