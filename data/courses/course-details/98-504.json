In the second half of this course, we extend these analytical techniques to study player performance over multiple matches and consider larger trends such as surface, tournament level, performance against top 51015, and other more general topics.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will gain a deep understanding of statistical techniques in tennis and data collection methods.
