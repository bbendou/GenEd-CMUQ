Starting  from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python  programming language, including its standard libraries and programming  paradigms.  We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including  standalone programs, shell scripts, and webbased applications.  This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a  fastpaced and rigorous preparation for 15122.  Students seeking a more  gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15110.    NOTE students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the prerequisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 3}], "website": "https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Develop computational problemsolving skills using Python.
