In addition, we will touch on focus groups, eyetracking analysis, and collaborative analysis techniques.  More specifically, in this class you will learn how to design wellworded questions that produce reliable information critically reflect on and improve your interview technique explore software designed to aid in openended analysis of qualitative data design an AB or controlexperimental study write a datadriven research report, and experiment with a range of data collection techniques.
