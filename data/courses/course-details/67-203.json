Students who take this course will gain a deep understanding of the diverse problems faced by people with disabilities in their interactions in a digital space and how the use of assistive technologies help them surmount the related accessibility barriers. They will learn about inclusive design principles and how to author content with consideration of design decisions that impact digital accessibility. Students will learn how to create electronic documents e.g., MS Word and pdf that can be easily accessed by people unhindered by a variety of disabilities such as visual or hearing impairments. They will also gain a highlevel understanding of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG and how to use basic tools and techniques to detect nonconformance of a website with accessibility standards.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The overarching goal is to help students understand how to apply universal design principles and methods to the conception of meaningful digital experiences.
