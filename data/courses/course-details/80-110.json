We will explore the foundations of mathematics, both in terms of their historical origin and their modern purpose as a base for the study of mathematics. Then we will see how problems which seem to have no intuitive solution look simple after being put in the right mathematical form, but also consider the limitations this type of approach. We will treat such issues as they arise both in applied fields policy decisionmaking, physics, computer science and as more recreational, speculative and abstract Conways game of life, the works of Escher, music.
