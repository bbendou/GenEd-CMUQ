The decision to outsource software services to providers in distant places has many risks and thus careful management of critical success factors is essential.  Likewise, products and services are being developed and delivered by teams of people in diverse locations working together. Management of these sourcing models and human capital relationships will be an increasingly important skill for students expecting to fully participate in the emerging IS marketplace of the 21st century.  This course introduces the effective fundamentals of global project management and the mechanics of sourcing arrangements including offshore outsourcing.  Students will also examine the effects of human diversity and crosscultural considerations in the creation, use and management of information systems.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Expectation", "slug": "expectation", "id": 311}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Course goals include 1 Understand the challenges of global information systems and its impact on society, organizations and managerial practices. 2 Explain the basics of global project management and the global project lifecycle including project evaluation, initiation, planning, budgeting and implementation. 3 Discuss the benefits, disadvantages, opportunities and challenges of outsourcing from multiple stakeholder perspectives. 4 Analyze the impact of technology on contemporary sociocultural issues from multiple perspectives including people, groups, organizations and society at large. 5 Analyze key issues in crosscultural collaboration across cultural and temporal boundaries. 6 Gain an understanding of teambuilding and collaboration including working with global third parties.", "key_topics": "This course addresses current technology-based challenges that result from global systems.
