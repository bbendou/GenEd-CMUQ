Leveraging high school algebra and basic Python programming skills from 15110, well help you implement key pieces of AI techniques from the nearest neighbor algorithm to simple neural networks. Through inclass activities, weekly recitations, and course assignments, youll start to learn how to use AI systems, including how to make them intelligent, what data might be needed, and what can go wrong.
