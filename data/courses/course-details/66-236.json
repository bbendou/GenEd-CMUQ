As part of this endeavor, students take part in informed discussions about interpretive lenses ways of seeing and thinking about social, cultural, and historical contexts for interpretations of environment and sustainability.  This seminarstyle course introduces key methods and approaches for interdisciplinary inquiry within a framework of Environmental Humanities and Environmental Justice. Scholar Giovanna de Chiro writes The term environmental justice emerged from the activism of communities of color in the United States in the latter half of the twentieth century...They advocate for social policies that uphold the right to meaningful, democratic participation of frontline communities in environmental decision making.  The implications of disciplinary narratives and approaches to questions of environment and sustainability, and the implications for social justice, are a key and repeated question in the course. The role of poverty as a cultural, political, and historical phenomenon is a motif in many of our discussions. Well explore contrasting historical, cultural, and disciplinary explanations for hunger, famine, and food insecurity. Further, well explore how socalled environmental explanations for food scarcity, which rationalize the persistence of hunger and poverty in the 21st century, have distracted from decades of expertise, reminding us that hunger and poverty are social problems. In contrast to these socalled environmental explanations, there is no scarcity of food in the present era. This course will examine how these narratives contradict each other, and why it matters.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Identify historical and narrative differences in approaches to environment and sustainability, from the late 19th century until present and the implications of these narratives for social justice.

Environmental problems are complex and require insights from both scientific and social perspectives. For example, it is not enough to tackle climate change solely by knowing the science; it is also very important to communicate well, and to understand the relevant ethics, economics, policy, and business aspects. In addition to the example of climate change, this course includes and draws awareness to concepts coming from different disciplines, especially humanistic disciplines, calling these \"Environmental Ideas.\" The course builds competence for students to identify, and name, different approaches for dealing with complex problems of environment and sustainability.", "learning_resources": "Mostly ebooks available through CMU Libraries and pdfs linked on Canvas.
