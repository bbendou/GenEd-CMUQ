The projects are designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and creativity.\n\nThere are two assessed projects in this course. Grades from both are aggregated, factoring in their respective percentage weightings, to establish an overall grade for the course.\n\nProject 1 - Design Thinking: A Creative Process for Tackling Complex Problems\nStudents work in teams using Design Thinking to tackle a social or environmental problem. They conduct design research to understand the needs of the target community, ideate innovative solutions, develop prototypes, and test ideas with the end-users or peers. The result is a creative and inspiring project to create positive social and/or ecological impacts. Final projects are presented in class at the end of the course, with Q&A from faculty and peers.\n\nProject 2 - Design Thinking Journal: A Journey of Insights\nStudents develop a reflective journal in Figma to document their learning journey, ongoing critical reflections, and insights as they emerge through the course. All journals will be shared at the end of the course with faculty and student peers.", "relevance": "Design turns existing situations into preferred ones.
