This course examines the domestic politics in the contemporary Middle East. It reviews the types of political systems present in the region and the developments that have taken place in the last decades, especially since the Arab Spring. The course is divided into two sections. The first part provides an introduction to the subfield of Political Science called Comparative Politics. Scholars in this subfield use comparative methods to study and compare domestic politics across countries. Here we will discuss how political regimes differ, discuss why they differ and explore the consequences of such variation. In the second section, we will examine the political systems that exist in the Middle East, and do a general review of the recent political trajectories of the countries of the region.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "At the end of the course, students will be able to 1.
