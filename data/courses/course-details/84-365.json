In terms of the courses structure, we will first focus on defining and characterizing fake news and misinformation, and next we will examine their production why are they created, consumption why are they believed, and consequences what influence do they have. Then, we will analyze the threat of misinformation in several important contexts  including COVID19, climate change, and armed conflict  and finally we will consider research and analysis about how to best counter it.
