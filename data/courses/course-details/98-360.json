Students can expect to become familiar with ideas pertaining to the meaning of truth, the recognition of thinking on multiple different levels, and how recursive ideas can produce incredible results in many different contexts, even going so far as to provide a foundation for human intelligence itself. These ideas are all grounded in and taught from the book Gdel, Escher, Bach an Eternal Golden Braid, the groundbreaking 1979 book published by professor Douglas Hofstadter that changed American intellectualism at its core.
