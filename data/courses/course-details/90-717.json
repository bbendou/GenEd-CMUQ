Writing for consulting firms, government agencies, think tanks, advocacy groups, industry associations, and other contexts in the sphere of public policy differs from academic writing. Accordingly, this course challenges students to convey critical thinking by anticipating readers needs and the perspectives of stakeholders in the practice of shaping public policy. The writing skills integral to this process include developing essential and persuasive content, communicating complex ideas, organizing information, targeting diverse audiences with varying levels of expertise and roles, ensuring clarity, controlling tone, and designing a document for readability. Students analyze realworld documents relevant to careers in public policy, craft strategic quotes for news releases, and write policy onepagers as well as policy memos.
