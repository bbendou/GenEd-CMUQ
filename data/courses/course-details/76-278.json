The modern film and literature have inherited unique premodern characteristics such as an openended plot without any closure, a nonlinear as well as linear way of storytelling, and a preference of atmosphere and beauty over a structured plot. On the other hand, partly owing to the Western influences, they have seen innovations in the art of storytelling e.g., contextualization of modern self in an openended story, filming techniques. The course focuses on the artistic media e.g., language, sound, color, film techniques of each film and literary work and their interactions with the plot and the historical and social contexts of each work. It also explores how the art of storytelling is in tandem with the vicissitudes of human condition as illustrated in Japans variety of films and literature in the twentieth and twentyfirst century. Analyses of each storytelling not only reveal cultural dynamics behind Japanese modernity, but also invite students to find new insights into Japanese culture and their ways to perceive our globalized world.
