In doing so, they are able to come into the lab prepared to perform the analysis. o Students technique skills and knowledge of mathematical concepts required for the course (in terms of precision and accuracy) are assessed through submission of data and summary sheets and accuracy scores. The data and summary sheets allow us to determine whether or not they understand the math required to analyze their data. The accuracy scores provide a measure of how good their technique is. Students are often provided analytical unknowns whose concentrations are well known. o Depth of understanding of the technique and its application are assessed through written lab reports and exams. Lab reports and exams are given throughout the semester covering the key topics: Titrations, Spectroscopy (& Chromatography) and Gravimetric Analysis.", "relevance": "This course is targeted to non-chemistry majors who have previously taken Modern Chemistry I and II. Students will thus apply the knowledge that they have learnt in these courses in a lab setting. They will gain both the knowledge and experience of working in an analytical chemistry laboratory. The course itself teaches them how to identify and use laboratory equipment, prepare solutions, perform titrations, use modern day analytical instruments such as a UV-Vis and AA spectrophotometer and HPLC. Students will also learn how to work safely in a laboratory by first learning how to identify hazards associated with chemicals and then learning how to dispose of these chemicals in a safe manner.", "learning_resources": "Students utilize Canvas for all course material. The syllabus, lecture notes, recitation activities and exam material are all provided on Canvas. Canvas is updated daily/weekly. - The textbook \"Exploring Chemical Analysis\" 6th edition by Daniel C Harris is referenced throughout the course. Purchase of the textbook is optional. Copies of the newest edition and older editions are on reserve in the Sorrells library in Wean Hall. - Students are given an 'in house' lab manual that provides information regarding safety, how to write the notebook, how to write reports, introductory background information on the experiments, as well as procedural information for the experiments. The manual also references and suggests problems from the Harris textbook. - Students are provided with an outline of lecture notes at the start of each lecture. - Students are provided with online videos that cover how to use each of the glassware/ equipment that they will be using throughout the semester - Students are provided with video tutorials demonstrating how to solve suggested problems given in the lab manual - Students are encouraged to use Piazza (online discussion forum) to ask questions. Teaching assistants, course instructors, and graders are all given access to Piazza and questions are often answered within minutes. - Each instructor, teaching assistants provide office hours on a as needed basis.", "extra_time_commitment": "There are no extra time commitments for this course.
