Yet multifamily housing is an essential typology to address rapid development and urbanization. Take on the challenge of creating high performance housing for our net zero future by exploring the technical and social demands of multifamily zero energy design or renovation. 48752 is a graduate level course designed to support that goal. Through lectures, outside research, discussion, and a final applied project, youll explore the design approaches, codes, policy, technology, and energy infrastructure options that can help you achieve the housing performance we know is essential for a sustainable future.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": "soa.cmu.edu", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Future Materials", "slug": "future-materials", "id": 1546}], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
