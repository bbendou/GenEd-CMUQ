However, in many cases there remains a significant gap between the promise of modern language technologies, where models are typically benchmarked on a relatively limited set of representative general purpose tasks, and the successful deployment of these tools for realworld applications. In practice, each domainspecific task requires special consideration andor adaptation, often consisting of task definition and dataset curation, experimentation to identify strengths and limitations of existing offtheshelf methods, and the formulation of an appropriate and computationallyfinancially feasible plan for adapting available affordances to fit the new domain or task of interest. In this class, students with concentrations outside of NLP e.g. degree programs in materials science or English and students with concentrations in or near NLP LTI, MLD or equivalent expertise will work with and learn from each other to bridge this gap.
