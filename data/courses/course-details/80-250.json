We will prepare the background for Socrates and Plato by studying major Presocratic philosophers such as the Milesians, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, and then dive in to a careful study of some of the central works of Plato and Aristotle. A key theme of the class will be the way in which Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle sought to define philosophy in opposition to sophistry, and how the lessons learned from their confrontation with sophistry informed their ethical and metaphysical thought. The final sections will discuss postAristotelian movements such as Epicureanism, Skepticism, and Stoicism.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy", "id": 1263}, {"name": "Comedy", "slug": "comedy", "id": 1757}], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Understand the origins and development of Ancient Greek Philosophy, how it distinguished itself from Sophistry, and how it generated debates and questions that still continue", "key_topics": "Presocratic Philosophy, Philosophy vs. Sophistry, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism", "prerequisite_knowledge": "No prior knowledge necessary", "assessment_structure": "Exams, Classroom Participation, Essays, etc.", "relevance": "Dietrich GenEd prior to 2021: Reflecting", "learning_resources": "Books, texts posted to canvas, etc.", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
