The course will build on the knowledge you have gained from the prerequisite courses we will develop your modelbuilding skills, explore some techniqueoriented skills such as linear, integer, and nonlinear programming, and experiment with heuristic solution methods. While going through different models and techniques, we will also see realworld examples of how these models are actually used in practical business environments.
