communicative possibilities. It provides students with the opportunity to create both an explainer video and a more persuasive animation merging text, spoken voice, music, images, and video clips. Students will learn the basic concepts and vocabulary of motion graphics, practical issues surrounding designs that change over time, and digital storytelling through handson projects. Inspiration is drawn from popular Vox and Ted Ed explainer videos that have come to represent the genre. Students explore writing and recording their own narration and how to best utilize elements of time, motion, and sound to enhance their visual communication skills. Adobe After Effects will be taught to complete assignments and explore multimedia possibilities. Some Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Audition will also be taught to support specific tasks. Basic experience with Photoshop or Illustrator prior to taking this class is helpful, but not required. Inclass discussions and critiques are essential components of the course.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Community Involvement", "slug": "community-involvement", "id": 1231}], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "lab component", "id": 11, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "maker", "id": 12, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Write a script and execute a design that guides the attention of the viewer visually and aurally simultaneously, while also considering what the viewer can read.\nPractice creating, editing and customizing graphics.\nPractice gaining control over the flow, timing and rhythm of the media using timelines and keyframed animations.\nPractice planning the structure of a piece with quickly made tools like storyboard sketches and timebased scratch tracks to create rough drafts to catch problems early in the process.\nPlay the role of writer, producer, designer and animator in the creation of 2 multimedia projects approximately 3 or 4 minutes long after completing 2 smaller practice projects.\nRecord and edit a quality voiceover recording.
