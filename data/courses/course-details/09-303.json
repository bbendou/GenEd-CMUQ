The ongoing epidemic of opioid addiction, arising both from overprescription of pain killers and recreational use of heroin, has been widely reported and continues to rise at alarming rates, ravaging our urban and rural communities. In this course, we will explore the complicated role of chemistry in this epidemic, including the good elucidating mechanisms of action, developing clinically useful and safe opioids and nonopioids and the bad design and synthesis of increasingly addictive opioids. We will also discuss ethical questions faced by the pharmaceutical industry that develops, markets and sells these drugs, the medical community that prescribes them, the government agencies charged with regulating these activities and law enforcement agencies that attempt to stop the flow of drugs into and within the United States. The second half of the semester will focus on addiction to other drugs, including cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, alcohol and nicotine. We will also discuss chemical approaches to treating addiction. Students who complete this course will emerge with a broad understanding and perspective on an issue that is of great scientific and societal importance.  The course will be organized in units that begin with a historicalsocietal big picture overview, followed by technical discussions of the underlying chemistry and biochemistry, concluding with consideration of the societal implications of addiction to each particular substance.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Upon completion of this course, students shouldUnderstand the molecular basis of drug addiction including administration, biodistribution, receptor binding and alterations in brain function.Connect diverse societal factors that facilitated the spread of opioid addiction, including both illicit production, trafficking and distribution of recreational drugs as well as development, approval and marketing of prescription drugs.Compare historical progression of different drugs through society, including opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, nicotine and alcohol.Be aware of new treatments for addiction.", "key_topics": "The course provides a holistic view of addiction to opiates and other substances.
