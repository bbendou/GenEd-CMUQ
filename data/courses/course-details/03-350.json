This is the factbased part of the course. Our focus will not be on memorizing everything that has been learned about development in all model organisms but on a thorough understanding of major concepts. We will also highlight what is NOT understood about this process i.e., important gaps in our current knowledge. 4 To understand the close relationship between developmental processes and human healthmedical science. 5 To be able to contribute productively to the resolution of important societalethical issues associated with human reproduction and development.", "key_topics": "Fertilization and early development, differential gene expression and cell differentiation, cell signaling, morphogenesis, regeneration, and stem cell biology.
