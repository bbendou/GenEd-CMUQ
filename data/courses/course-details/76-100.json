Experiences in the course give students the opportunity to draw on multiple cultural and linguistic understandings and practices when analyzing and creating meaningful texts. The course emphasizes critical reading and research strategies for a variety of sources which become the basis for individually and collaborativelyproduced texts. The course introduces students to rhetorical choices within and across languages at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels. Students will explore a variety of practices in academic writing e.g., paraphrase, synthesis, counterargument and refutation, citation as they relate to genre, audience, purpose, and other factors of a communicative situation. We discuss and practice explicit rhetorical and linguistic conventions for writing in academic English so that writers make choices to connect with readers in academic and professional discourse communities. Students who take this course identify as multilingual students who use English skillfully but perhaps with less comfort as they use another language. These students complete an online placement process that guides them through making their own informed course placement. Students may also skip the placement process and enroll directly into the course. For some students, 76100 is a prerequisite requirement for other firstyear writing courses therefore, students should check with their academic advisors regarding how 76100 fulfills their general education course requirements. All 76100 courses are structured by the learning objectives shared across sections of the course, but sections present different themes in their readings.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/academic-programs/writing-and-communication/index.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The goals for students as multilingual writers at Carnegie Mellon stretch beyond the context of 76100.

Alternatively, students can choose to forgo the placement exam if they prefer to enroll in 76-100 during their first semester.\n\n76-100 requires a different set of written assignments and focuses on a different set of skills than the other First-Year Writing course offerings.
