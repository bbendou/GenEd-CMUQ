This course covers the progress of stem cell research and its application to tissue engineering and regenerative therapy. The students will learn about the different types of stem cells, the biochemical stimuli that are responsible for regulating stem cell differentiation and techniques involved in the culture of stem cells. This subject will also highlight the development of various biomaterials that are used as biological substitutes in regenerative therapy. Current and emergent stem cell technologies in selected applications of tissue engineering in bone, skin and vascular tissues will be emphasized. The course will be delivered through problembased learning where students are expected to participate in discussions, perform literature search, present their findings through presentations and written reports on selected topics. The class is designed for undergraduates with a strong interest in stem cell biology and tissue engineering, and the desire to actively contribute to discussions in the class.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will learn about tissue, structure and function and how stem cells can be used effectively in regenerative medicine by looking at medical case studies.
