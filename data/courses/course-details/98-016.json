If students cannot submit videos for any reason, they have the option to submit a short write-up analysis of the current team/ rotation being discussed. Students may also be asked to submit short writings about lore and lore related theory.\nAll assignments will be submitted through canvas unless otherwise stated.\n\nAny assignments submitted up to 1 week late will receive a maximum of 75% credit and an additional 15% is removed for each day it is late after that. Assignments submitted over two weeks past the due date will receive no credit.\n\nStudents may submit a request for an extension or to make up work up to 24 hours before the due date. Students simply need to provide a reasonable excuse and instructors will be very understanding.\n\nAssigned work other than the final will be graded on effort and completion.\n\nAs a midterm exam, students will be asked to demonstrate their favorite team for the class.\n\nThe final exam will consist of a multiple-choice portion in which students will demonstrate knowledge of game mechanics, and a free response portion in which students will craft a team to deal with a theoretical abyss chamber.\n\nAttendance and participation: 50%\nAssignments: 30%\nMid-Term: 5%\nFinal Exam (don't worry too much about this): 15%\n\nA final grade of 70% or above is required to pass the course.", "relevance": "Many Carnegie Mellon Students play Genshin Impact.
