This course is part of the postintermediate, 300level program that forms the introduction to the major or minor in Spanish. In addition to enriching cultural proficiency by improving an understanding of Latin America, its people and its cultures, and developing critical skills in a progression from comprehension to analysis and interpretation, the course advances grammatical accuracy and verbal communication in the Spanish language.  The inclass setting will be studentcentered, and thus highly interactive. Assignments will include reflective essays, individualized research, and the generation, expression, analysis, and rewriting of ideas. Reading and writing skills will be complemented by continued oral practice in the form of small and large group discussions and class presentations.
