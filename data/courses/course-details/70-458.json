For better and for worse, a lot of this data does not fit nicely into the clean, precise, and carefully structured tabular formats perfected by computer scientists and IT professionals in the latter part of the 20th century. Rather, this data youve probably heard it called Big Data, Unstructured Data, LooselyStructured Data, 4k Video, etc. comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and in volumes that are so large they require new ways of thinking about capturing, managing, and working with it.   In this course, you will learn to work with big, looselystructured data sets to better understand the world and make better decisions as you operate within it. We will explore a wide variety of different approaches to representing data graphs, data documents, key,value pairs, geopolygons, Big Tables, massive text indices, etc. and the tools that use those data stores to uncover insights and help you make good business decisions.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "lab component", "id": 11, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students who attend class and complete the assigned work will learn to work with a wide range of data representations and data management tools.
