First we will conceptualize learners as readers and writers who bring diverse experiences and abilities to the classroom. We will then grapple with the questions about what we should teach our students, or which genres should students learn to write. To clarify the what question, we will consider frameworks from genrebased pedagogy, corpusbased pedagogy, and antiracist pedagogy as they apply to teaching FirstYear Writing and across disciplines. Finally, we will employ instructional design principles so that students will develop and situate their own pedagogical interventions within an existing curriculum that they have selected. Regular course requirements include brief synthesis papers of the course readings and a final project developed according to students particular interests.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "http://www.cmu.edu/hss/english/courses/courses.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Connect a view of writing knowledge and expertise with a developmental model of learning\nApply theories of learner, context, and genre for designing writing instruction.\nDistinguish between researchbased teaching practices versus trialanderror teaching practices\nExplain core principles of instructional design and apply those principles to your own lesson plans and methods for writing instruction.\nEmploy theories of composition and pedagogy to analyze the affordances of particular instructional tools for diverse learners e.g., rubrics, technologies\nDevelop a flexible toolkit for designing courses that you will be able to use beyond the boundaries of our current context", "key_topics": "Writing instruction\n\n\n\nInstructional Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenre & Learning Transfer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhetorical Education", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Students should have a desire to teach reading and writing within the university context, but no teaching experience or instructional design experience is necessary before taking this course.", "assessment_structure": "Synthesis Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Responses to Readings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaborative Discussion Starter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask-Focused Lesson Plan + Microteaching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Observation & Reflection\n\n\n\nTopic proposal for final project\n\n\n\nFinal Projects & Presentations", "relevance": "The course is required for PhD students because they will be teaching at CMU.
