These systems are the fascinating connections between the oceans, atmosphere, continents, ecosystems, and people that provide our planet with resources that all life depends on. Human activities disrupt these natural systems, posing critical threats to the sustainable functioning of environmental systems. We will explore how solar and biochemical energy moves through the Earths interconnected systems, recycling nutrients how complex environmental systems function to produce critical resources such as food and water and how human activities interfere with these systems. Earth science concepts will be used to explain the relationship between climate zones and biomes, the stability of the Earths climate in the Holocene, and the instability in the current Anthropocene. Case studies include the interplay between climate change feedbacks, wildfires, ecosystems, and agricultural systems the hazards that everyday chemical toxins pose to ecosystems and human health and reproduction and growing threats to ecosystem health and biodiversity. We will also develop the relevant science and information literacy required to understand current issues that are frequently debated in the public sphere, and connect these to environmental justice.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Understand how major environmental systems and their underlying components and processes function and in doing so sustain life on Earth by providing a habitable and stable climate, food, water, energy, nutrients, and other material resources.Develop the proficiency in environmental, scientific, and information literacy required to understand, evaluate, and contribute to discussions regarding current environmental sustainability challenges and their proposed solutions.
