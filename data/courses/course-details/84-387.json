The development of technologies like missiles, drones,  the internet have changed the character of warfare by enabling actors to use lethal force  cause disruption thousands of miles away from the battlefield. Technological advancements have arguably even led to the creation of an entirely humanmade domain of warfare the cyber domain that is distinct from the land, sea, air  space domains. This course will analyze the impact of drones  the cyber domain on international conflict. We will study the historical origins of these technologies, why  how they have spread, their use  effectiveness on the battlefield, ethical questions surrounding their use,  whether arms control is possible. How is the information revolution in computing similar  different from prior revolutions in military affairs Are drones and the cyber domain transforming conflict by giving the offense a significant advantage over the defense, or is their offensive and destructive potential exaggerated Is coercion possible in cyberspace, or does the attribution problem impede deterrence Might drones actually reduce the risks of escalation in interstate conflict by removing the desire for revenge if a pilot is killed How has the internet been weaponized to enable economic warfare and election interference Might cyber espionage undermine the United States military advantage, and should the US ban TikTok Do drones decrease or increase terrorism Is remote warfare  the use of lethal autonomous weapons systems sometimes referred to as killer robots inherently unethical These are just a handful of the questions we will explore in this class.

Explain the historical development of the technologies underlying remote systems and the cyber domain in conflict, as well as how they have been used.4. Describe alternate perspectives on whether arms control is possible, the ethics of conducting warfare from a distance, etc. and formulate personal viewpoints.5.
