This course will teach the skills, processes, and mindset to identify the right problems that need to be solved and then develop innovative solutions to those challenges, ensuring these solutions provide value for those using it.  With this ability, the technical and problem solving skills of the other engineering disciplines can be brought to bear to create breakthrough products and services.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "entrepreneurship", "id": 4, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "One of the goals of this class is to create engineers that are prepared to be leaders in their professional fields.
