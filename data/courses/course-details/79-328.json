Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant imagemakers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others. Classes include a slide lecture, student presentation, and video segments that introduce a focused selection of images by major photographers in an attempt to understand their intentions, styles, and influences. As available, students will be expected to make one or more visits to photography exhibitions on view in Pittsburgh locations to be announced at the first class.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will obtain an understanding of the history of photography and how photographic images have been used to affect change in many different contexts.", "key_topics": "The course will cover the history of photography from the perspectives of popular culture, fine art, science, and journalism from World War II to the present day.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Students should have an interest in art history and visual culture, and be comfortable doing independent research and critical writing.", "assessment_structure": "There will be extensive reading, a mid-semester and final exam, along with a student presentation.", "relevance": "This course will give you a broad understanding of how photographic images have influenced culture in variety of ways and give you an appreciation for photography and the visual arts.", "learning_resources": "Students will be required to read from a main course text and other supplemental readings that will be provided on Canvas.", "extra_time_commitment": "Students will be required to make two off-campus museum and gallery visits."}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
