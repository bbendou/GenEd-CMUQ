Music in Motion is a class based around the Eurhythmics style of teaching, which helps students make deeper connections with the music they listen to and interact with. As a movementbased class, this class allows you to internalize the music and feel the feels by moving your body and learning kinesthetically. In each class, students will engage with music, either live or recorded, in various group settings that will invite them to view music differently and engage actively with their peers. Music in Motion is a class environment that encourages play, allows for mistakes, and invites students to make choices about how they interact with the space and people around them.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students by the end of the course will be more proficient in producing accurate rhythms either through clapping, stepping, or singing.
