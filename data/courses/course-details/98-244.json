However, the speed of the lyrics and the difficulty of the song will be taken into consideration. Use the audio from the reference video while you sign is permitted, but you are not allowed to watch the video as you sign it (and should be making eye contact with the camera). Assignments will be due every Sunday at 11:59pm on Canvas.\n\nMidterm: Will take place at the beginning of class the seventh week. For each of the previous weeks' songs, a random group of students will sign a song in front of the class. Grades will be based 50% on sign completeness and 50% on effort.\n\nFinal Project: Students will pick a song with lyrics to present to the class. Working in groups is encouraged, and for the size of the group, the minimum time required is variable as shown below. You will be graded 50% on sign correctness and 50% on creativity, showmanship, and effort.\n\nEven though there is a minimum time, doing the whole song is encouraged. Doing minimum time, the time begins when the lyrics begin. You are allowed to edit the songs, do a mashup, take turns on the verses, create dances, etc. Be creative!
