Foremost, environmental psychology studies the relationship between human behavior and the environment, both urban and natural, and how on the one hand, environment impacts human behavior, and on the other hand, how humans influence the environment. Essentially, environmental psychology aims to improve human behavior for the good of the planet and our shared future.\nIn this course, we examine psychological mechanisms behind behaviors that are both pro-and contra-environmental and use insight from research to design and discuss interventions to increase pro-environmental behaviors. We will explore both individual factors (cognitive processes, motivation, behavior change, connection with nature) and social factors (cultural worldviews, group relationships, media messages, social movements), with a special consideration for the local context. We will also examine how individual and societal narratives form ideas about the environment, and explore our own ecosophy while engaging in critical self-reflection. Throughout the semester, students will apply the course content to real-life experiences (i.e. exploring natural and urban environments while working on assignments; engaging with community researchers and activists) and will work on research-informed (stewardship) projects at the levels of self and community.", "learning_resources": "Natural world, scientific articles, popular culture, books, case studies, websites, field trips and experiential learning", "extra_time_commitment": "Yes.
