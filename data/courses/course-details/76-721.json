In addition to watching the professional players onstage, spectators also participated in a form of play themselves, in a sense, because theatrical experience provided a unique opportunity to engage imaginatively with otherwise inaccessible people, worlds, and ideas. More than four hundred years later, the drama of the period now ranks among the most esteemed texts in all English literature, and the name Shakespeare has become a byword for literary genius. This course will offer a selection of Shakespeares delightfuland sometimes surprisingly edgycomedies and late romances. As we read through these works, we will endeavor to understand what, and how, they meant in their original context, thereby developing a historically informed perspective on their influence over our own cultural landscape.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1 To consider the cultural legacy of early modernity through the lens of Shakespearean drama.\n2 To engage questions of meaning and interpretation that typically attend to performancebased artworks.\n3 To hone key skills pertaining to humanities scholarship research, critical writing, appraisal, argumentation, discussion, presentation.", "key_topics": "Shakespeare, drama, performance, early modern literature", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "informal online writing assignments, two formal essays, classroom discussion & participation, class presentations", "relevance": "There isn't really a targeted group here.
