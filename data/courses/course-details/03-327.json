Evolutionary trees phylogenies and multiple sequence alignments provide evidence for predicting structural and functional constraints, sites of molecular interaction, and residues that confer functional specificity.  In 2021, phylogenetics is emerging as an essential technique in metagenomics, cancer, and infectious disease, driven by technological advances such as high throughput sequencing and singlecell phenotyping.  This course covers both the conceptual foundation and the practical skills of evolutionary bioinformatics.   Students will acquire the tree thinking skills required for critical interpretation of phylogenetic analyses and figures in the literature and a rigorous understanding of phylogenetic inference methods.  Theoretical knowledge will be complemented by handson experience with sequence data repositories, bioinformatic tools for database retrieval, sequence analysis, and tree building.  Students will walk out of the course with the knowledge required to apply those tools correctly to messy, genuine data sets, and the ability to evaluate alternate hypotheses in light of these bioinformatic analyses.

Some examples include:\n\n-Tracking pandemics: Strain phylogenies, combined with epidemiological data, are crucial for early identification of COVID-19 variants with enhanced transmission, virulence and/or mutability. Comparative methods predict specific mutations that likely contribute to those phenotypes, which can then guide vaccine and drug design.\n-Multidrug resistance in bacteria: Similarly, phylogenetic approaches are used to track the spread of multidrug resistance in bacteria in hospital settings and to capture in vivo adaptations within patients.\n-Uncovering developmental pathways: Tree models of cell division and differentiation provide a foundation for exploiting high-throughput single-cell data to study tissue formation. This approach is already in use for studying tumorigenesis but is now emerging as a general technique in cell and developmental biology.\n-Metagenomics and the microbiome: High-volume, low-cost sequencing of environmental samples provides an unprecedented insight into the unculturable microbial world. Phylogenetics is essential for taxonomic profiling of these samples and for characterizing their metabolic capabilities.\n\nIn 2021, the ability to interpret trees is a fundamental requirement for scientific literacy. A survey of Science and Nature over a three month period in the last year shows that, on average, there is at least one evolutionary tree figure per issue. Interpreting such figures is not innate; it is a learned skill (\"tree thinking\") that our students will need in order to read and interpret the scientific literature.\n\nIn summary, 03-327/727 teaches practical, general skills that students can use in many settings, as well as abstract concepts that", "learning_resources": "Primary textbook: Molecular Evolution: A Phylogenetic Approach 1st Edition, Page & Holmes, Wiley-Blackwell, 1999.
