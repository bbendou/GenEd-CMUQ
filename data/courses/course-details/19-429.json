The first part will provide a primer for those who are curious about the physical mechanisms by which climate is determined, and by which climate change occurs. The treatment of these mechanisms will not be overly quantitative, and no knowledge of meteorology or atmospheric science is needed. Collegelevel physics, as well as basic calculus and basic chemistry, is, however, needed. The second part will describe the projected consequences of climate change, as well as those that are already occurring. This part will also familiarize students with how societies might adapt to these changes. The third part will explore and critique some of the tools that decisionmakers use to quantify and compare the damages caused by these consequences. The final part of the course will discuss some of the technologies that could be used to prevent dangerous climate change.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Physical Chemistry", "slug": "physical-chemistry", "id": 240}, {"name": "Damage Mechanics", "slug": "damage-mechanics", "id": 818}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": "Climate change science (40%); climate change impacts and adaptation (30%); climate change mitigation (20%); environmental economics (10%)", "prerequisite_knowledge": "There are no pre-requisite courses\nCollege-level physics, basic calculus, and basic chemistry are required.\nStudents from outside of CIT should have graduate standing, and be comfortable with quantitative analysis.", "assessment_structure": "No final exam\nOne mid-term on climate science (20% of the grade)\nIn-class quizzes (25% of the grade)\nShort essays (25% of the grade)\nIn-class presentation (10% of the grade)\nParticipation on on-line class discussion forum (10% of the grade)\nSmall project to run climate model (10% of the grade)", "relevance": null, "learning_resources": "Recommended text book: Hartmann, Dennis L.
