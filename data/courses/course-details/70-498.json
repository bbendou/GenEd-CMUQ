Accounting numbers Accounting numbers such as those in published corporate financial statements obey a basic doubleentry bookkeeping structure leading to a matrix or graph representation beyond the typical numerical data structure. After a basic introduction of using corporate financial data, much of the course covers the concepts and tools that process corporate accounting data using the graph representation.  Accounting texts While texts in accounting documents are written in natural language, they must obey regulatory disclosure requirements in both substance and form. The remaining part of the course shows students how data in text form from accounting disclosures such as annual reports can be examined systematically using textual analysis techniques to gain further insight and knowledge about firms and industries beyond those inferred from nontextual data.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The central focus of course is on the structure of business language in both numbers and texts, notnecessarily on analytical tools and techniques which would likely change over time.
