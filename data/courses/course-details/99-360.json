Electronics and Textiles are both pervasive aspects of our lives. At first they might seem like opposites. One is thought of as rigid, structured, and high tech while the other is viewed as soft, flexible, and one of our oldest technologies. In this workshop students will learn how combining these two opens a world of possibilities. We will cover multiple approaches for robustly constructing soft circuits and sensors as well as the unique challenges associated with adding electronics to a textile and adding flexibility to a circuit. Students will construct several swatches to explore techniques and materials.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Textiles", "slug": "textiles", "id": 1467}], "attributes": [{"name": "ideate", "id": 8, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "lab component", "id": 11, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "maker", "id": 12, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "After taking this class, students will be able to Construct a flexible circuit using multiple construction methods Create new samples that integrate electronics and textiles effectively Make design choices that will improve the integration of electronics and textiles", "key_topics": "Soft Circuits, Soft sensors, Sewable Microcontrollers", "prerequisite_knowledge": "No prerequisite Knowledge is required for this course.
