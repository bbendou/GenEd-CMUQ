During many recent years, one of those teams has earned the right to represent Carnegie Mellon at the ICPC World Finals.

Preparation involves the study of algorithms, the practice of programming and debugging, the development of test sets, and the growth of team, communication, and problem solving skills. Neither the course grade nor the number of units earned are dependent on ranking in any contest. Students are not required to earn course credit to participate in practices or to compete in ACMICPC events.
