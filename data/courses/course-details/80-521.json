In this seminar we will read and analyze contemporary papers on these topics, both to gain an understanding of the current stateoftheart, and to critically assess the extent to which these formal frameworks are genuinely enhancing our understanding of the underlying phenomena of interest.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Dynamics", "slug": "dynamics", "id": 814}], "attributes": [{"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
