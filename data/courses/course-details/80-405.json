Famous examples include the Prisoners Dilemma pitting rational selfinterest against the benefits of cooperation, and the Cournot duopoly a basic model of market competition and supplyanddemand. Game theory has been applied to situations as diverse as traffic flow, auctions, the search and competition for scarce resources, and bargaining.  This course will develop conceptual and technical facility with the mathematical tools used to model and analyze such situations. We will cover games in strategic and extensive form and games of perfect and imperfect information well also study solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and rationalizability. Finally, throughout the course we will take the opportunity to actually play several of the games we study to help build intuitions and foster insights into the formal mathematical models we develop.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Resource Model", "slug": "resource-model", "id": 245}, {"name": "Games", "slug": "games", "id": 859}, {"name": "Game Theory", "slug": "game-theory", "id": 1343}], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will learn how to read and understand gametheoretic models in a variety of contexts navigate the landscape of solution concepts and find equilibria in games formalize intuitions and analyze problems using gametheoretic tools probe and critically assess the underlying assumptions of standard game theory.", "key_topics": "The course will cover basic concepts in contemporary Game Theory, such as: mixed strategies, Nash equilibrium, correlated equilibrium, rationalizability, repeated games, sequential games, and bargaining theory.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Some prior exposure to reading and writing mathematical proofs will be very helpful, along with some basic knowledge of probability.", "assessment_structure": "Most of the grade will be based on take-home problem sets assigned every 2 weeks.
