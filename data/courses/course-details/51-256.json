Students will achieve these goals by engaging in a creative process where they will sketch, iterate, test, and refine graphic symbols and typography using conventional paper and pencils as well as Adobe Illustrator. Throughout the course, well also discuss communication trends and the role technology plays in shaping how and where brands appear in our everyday lives.
