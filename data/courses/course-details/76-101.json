A fullsemester course experience, 76101 introduces students to foundational practices for reading, synthesizing and producing scholarly knowledge within an academic context. Within the course, students learn transferable, genrebased skills applicable to a variety of different fields. Students use a comparative genre analysis method for using models to complete new writing tasks, including an academic research proposal and a research article that contributes to an ongoing academic conversation. Faculty who teach 76101 typically select a range of texts e.g., scholarship, journalism, film about an unresolved issue, so that students can identify relevant questions to frame their own research projects. Students should expect explicit, researchbased instruction within the course, reflecting upon their writing processes, as well as planning, drafting and revising drafts. Because the course emphasizes authentic stakes and purposes for communicating with academic audiences, students will regularly share  their work with their peers in oral and written forms within an interactive and collaborative classroom environment.

Our full-semester courses offer students the opportunity to read deeply about a controversial issue or topic.
