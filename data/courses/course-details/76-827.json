This course traces the history of audiences by juxtaposing understandings from rhetoric, composition studies, media scholarship, social interactions, technical communication genres, focusing especially on emerging technologies like AI. Students in this class will learn to use several sources of data and information to analyze the audiencetaskscontexts for the design and development of information products, assess its effectiveness through user experience research, and reflect on ethical research practices for doing the same. The course provides in depth coverage of rhetoric as a historically rooted but evolving humanistic perspective covering circulation and reproduction, performance and text, and delineating its connections to logic, aesthetics, politics, and ethics.
