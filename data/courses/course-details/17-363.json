Finally, a coverage of intermediate optimization and code generation offers the opportunity to discuss both producing efficient code and reasoning about the correctness of program transformations.  Assignments involve a combination of toolassisted formal reasoning and proofs about programming languages, and implementing these language constructs in a compiler.
