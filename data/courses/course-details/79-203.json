An understanding of the profound and rapid political and social changes that have occurred in this region will enable you to see global politics in a new light, and better understand the modern era.  This course is a survey of the history of modern Central and Eastern Europe, from late 18th to late 20th century. It begins with a focus on modern Habsburg empire, the rise of nationalism in mid 19th century, and the demise of the AustroHungarian empire following the First World War. It continues with an examination of the rise of illiberal politics during the interwar era, the Second World War, and the establishment of the communist regimes and the Soviet sphere of influence during the Cold War.  Course materials include secondary historical analyses, primary sources, memoirs, and documentaries. The course will rely heavily on the format of interactive lectures, a combination of lecture and discussion, which will productively challenge the students to engage with the material in a critical manner, and will help them contextualize and enrich the knowledge they gain from the course readings.

They will represent two generations of historical actors, whose long lives spanned a century and a half of radical political and social change.\n\nThe point of this exercise is for you to place this individual in the context of his/her own historical time. That is, you will constantly aim to link his or her life story (\"your\" story) to important events, historical actors, and social and political phenomena that had characterized the history of the interwar Central and Eastern Europe. In order to do so, you will use the class readings, as well as your discussion and lecture notes.\n\nThe assignment is also an exercise in historical imagination. You should feel free to describe your character's life (\"your life\") as creatively as you may wish. At the same time, you should aim for historical accuracy.
