What do they mean Why was it necessary to invent them How do we know when we are being confronted with them What should we do then This course surveys the history of genocide, weapons of mass destruction, and related phenomena. Can you imagine being responsible for the deaths of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of people No Almost everyone who ended up committing unspeakable atrocities had not been able to either. In fact, many of them still would not face their responsibility even after their complicity has been proven beyond doubt. Some convinced themselves, often sincerely, that there was no choice or that someone else was actually responsible. Others found reasons to justify, in their minds at least, taking many lives. Still others managed to forget that they had blood on their hands. How could anyone do such terrible things More importantly, can you be sure that you would not act like them under similar circumstances This course will teach you to look out for factors that turn ordinary people into mass killers. You will explore why conflicts break out and potential solutions. You will also learn to see from multiple perspectives and to be humble before history. Our exploration will begin with the European encounter with the Western Hemisphere and continue to 19thcentury imperialism, the Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Japan, the Cold War, and decolonization and independence. By the end, you will have grasped the historical facts and contemporary concepts of genocide and weapons of mass destruction. You will also come to appreciate the significance of unintended consequences and the ambiguity of human progress, a realization that will guide you in life.
