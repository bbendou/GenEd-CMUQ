When successful, such attacks can have devastating consequences for individuals, companies, and society in general. We have seen multiple instances of successful attacks on decentralized applications built on Blockchain, some of which have wiped out billions of dollars of cryptocurrencies in just a matter of hours. It has happened to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and more recently Terra and is almost guaranteed to happen again to the old or new blockchains. As more and more money flows into the crypto ecosystem, the incentive for bad guys to attack the system goes us, hence the importance of having the fundamental knowledge of how to protect yourself from such attacks becomes more profound.
