Because the liberal political tradition is also strongly egalitarian in nature, the course will examine different conceptions of political equality and conflicting views about the respects in which community members may have a just claim to equal treatment. Readings are drawn from classic works by authors such as Hobbes, Locke, Kant, and Mill, and from the works of contemporary theorists like Rawls, Nozick and others.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics", "id": 1191}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy", "id": 1263}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
