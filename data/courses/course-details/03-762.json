As such it will assume little or no background but will rapidly progress to discussions of papers from the primarily literature.  The structure of the course will be about half lectures and half discussions of new and classic papers from the primary literature.  These discussions will be substantially led by students in the course.  Topics covered will include ion channels and excitability, synaptic transmission and plasticity, molecular understanding of brain disease and cell biology of neurons.  Assessment will be based on class participation, including performance on inclass presentations and a writing assignment.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Molecular Biology", "slug": "molecular-biology", "id": 153}, {"name": "Neuroscience", "slug": "neuroscience", "id": 170}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
