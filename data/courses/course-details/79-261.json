In fact, Chinas last emperors were actually Manchus from northeast Asia. Secondly we investigate the social, economic, intellectual and demographic developments that transformed lateimperial China prior to the coming of the West. Thirdly, we examine Qing responses to a string of nineteenthcentury disruptions, including but not limited to western imperialism, that threatened to not only end the dynasty but also challenged the very tenants of Chinese civilization. Lastly, we will look at the fall of Chinas imperial system, the end of empire, and the postimperial struggle to reformulate the state and reimagine society for the twentieth century.
