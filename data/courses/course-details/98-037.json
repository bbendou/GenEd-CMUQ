During the span of this course, I hope to teach students how to use the free 3D modeling software called Blender. To do so, I want to introduce students to the 4 main components of 3D modeling lighting, geometric manipulation vertices, edges, and faces, rendering, texturing and basic animation. In addition, I want to make this course projectbased so students can explore a variety of rendering styles for instance, photorealistic, minimalistic, etc. and also give students the freedom to explore which area of 3D modeling they are particularly interested in product engineering, architecturalspace visualization, character design, etc..", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": "http://www.cmu.edu/stuco/", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
