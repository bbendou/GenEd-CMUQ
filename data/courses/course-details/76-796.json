Nonprofits achieve their missions by advocating on behalf of their organizations cause, raising public awareness about issues surrounding their cause, and fundraising to make their advocacy possible. In this course, students will select a local, Pittsburgharea nonprofit to examine and produce materials based on the organizations needs. Over the course of the semester students will research the organizations persona and values via interviews with chosen organizations staff and analysis of existing communication channels and different forms of content currently used by the organization. Students will use this research and analyses to inform and shape a final project that should meet the specified, needed deliverables from the selected nonprofit. Previous example projects include Revising a newsletter and specifying future best practices for an organization developing new format and copy for an organizations website developing a social media campaign for an upcoming event developing a grant proposal for an organizations project among many others. Students will have a wide selection of organizations to choose from and know projects associated with the organization at the beginning of the semester, as these will be organized by the professor. At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio ready material and an increased understanding as to how nonprofit organizations advance their causes.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": "http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/index.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Digital Arts", "slug": "digital-arts", "id": 1351}, {"name": "Print Making", "slug": "print-making", "id": 1466}, {"name": "On A Budget", "slug": "on-a-budget", "id": 1559}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "service learning", "id": 15, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will have a portfolio ready material and an increased understanding as to how nonprofit organizations advance their causes.", "key_topics": "non-profits, marketing, social media, fundraising, storytelling, grantwriting, creating meaningful messages", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "Short analysis papers, two short presentations, and a final project fulfilling a non-profit's desired deliverable", "relevance": "We will be working in tandem with local non-profit organizations to create a professional, portfolio ready material based on the non-profit's needs.
