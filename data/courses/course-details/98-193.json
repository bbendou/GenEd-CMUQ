The course begins by introducing the basic principles of quantum computing and the fundamental concepts of qubits, quantum gates, superposition, entanglement, and quantum algorithms. It covers topics such as quantum circuits and quantum applications. The course is structured to accommodate learners with diverse backgrounds, including those with little or no prior knowledge of computer science. It is designed to provide a solid foundation in quantum computing, with a focus on practical applications that are currently being developed and explored. Throughout the course, participants will be exposed to a range of quantum computing tools and techniques, including quantum simulators and programming languages. They will also be introduced to some of the key players in the field and the latest research and developments.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "lab component", "id": 11, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The primary goal of the quotIntro to Quantum Computingquot course is to provide students with acomprehensive understanding of the basics of quantum computing.
