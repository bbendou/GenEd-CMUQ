For the past five centuries, massive and rich financial data has been generated and intensively used to aid investment decisions in capital markets and business strategies by corporations. More recently, the realm of financial reporting has been significantly augmented along the new dimension of sustainability reporting due to the rapidly growing trend of sustainabilityoriented investing and investors demand for sustainabilityrelated data. The course is aimed at anyone whose career might involve working with financial and sustainability data and should be especially useful for those interested in investing, banking, and consulting careers. Throughout the semester, we will discuss the regulatory and corporate environments that govern the generating process of financial and sustainability data and how understanding such datagenerating process helps with drawing implications from the financial and sustainability data about corporate valuations, business strategies, etc. This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.
