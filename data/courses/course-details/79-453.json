An estimated 1 billion humans do not have satisfactory drinking water an estimated 2 billion do not have access to adequate sanitation facilities for human health, safety, and dignity.  For more than a hundred years, to address social inequalities in access to water, international organizations and scholars have created their own theories and ideas about providing water. This international community points out the social and cultural implications of technical provision of water resources. These debates about development showcase diverse theories, recommendations, and contradictions. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to critical studies of water and development.
