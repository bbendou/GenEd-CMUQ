Irrespective of the available preventive measures (such as encryption), attacks in the cyberspace are happening almost in daily basis. Such attacks are not limited to the digital world only. In the past, digital information and the computer have also been used for launching attacks in the physical world (e.g., in kidnapping someone). This course aims to study the aftermath of such attacks to understand how such attacks happened. This is essential for (i) bringing the culprit into justice, (ii) limiting the influence of an ongoing attack, and (iii) being better prepared for future attacks.", "learning_resources": "Quizzes, Computer Lab, Take Home Assessment", "extra_time_commitment": "2-3 hours per week"}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
