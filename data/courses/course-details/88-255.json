This course gives you a systematic approach to understanding how people, firms, or countries interact with one another to achieve their own goals.  We focus on the practical application of theorybased strategic principles and on their behavioral validity whereas traditional game theory courses usually focus on formal modeling techniques. Readings will focus on reallife stories accompanied by a full analysis of the principles involved. The class will be organized as a seminar, centered around discussion, not lecture.
