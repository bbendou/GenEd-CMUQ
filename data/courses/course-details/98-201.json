If waitlisted, please contact instructor directly for availability. What makes a romantic relationship work? When do these relationships begin to fall apart? In this course, we will ground our cinematic expectations of romance within the pragmatics of emotional availability, long-distance, and human sexuality. Throughout the semester, students will be introduced to the subtleties of fate, the nuances of infidelity, and the boundaries of attachment within both healthy and dysfunctional on-screen partnerships, as seen across cinema's most pragmatic films on romantic relationships. To successfully complete this course, you must have a demonstrated interest in becoming conversant in film (or relationships) before graduation -- and of course, you'll have to have a little faith in people. A course fee of $10/student will be collected at the beginning of the semester towards weekly refreshments and lecture series.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Cinema", "slug": "cinema", "id": 1430}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
