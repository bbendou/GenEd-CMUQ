The general public may know a thing or two about contemporary hiphop, mainly because of how mainstream it is. This course aims to introduce students to how hiphop started and what it stands for. Its important to look to the very beginning because the grounds that hiphop were built on explain best why hiphop is so significant today. It also aims to teach them how it changes over time and why the sounds differ significantly every decade. They will also learn at a foundational level what makes some hiphop artists more influential, political, uplifting etc. using different types of hiphop. Towards the end of the course, we will be looking close into how hip hop influences the people and its significant impact on western culture.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Root", "slug": "root", "id": 9}, {"name": "Hip-Hop", "slug": "hip-hop", "id": 1772}, {"name": "Hip Hop", "slug": "hip-hop091", "id": 1829}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
