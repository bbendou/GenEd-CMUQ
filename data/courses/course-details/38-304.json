This course introduces students to frameworks for identifying the linguistic features of scientific argumentation in research papers across a range of scientific disciplines to improve their reading and writing of scientific content. The course also examines how scientific information changes when it is reported in the popular media and the effects these changes have on nonexperts understanding of science. Students will use these changes as a model for writing about scientific research to nonexpert audiences. Finally, this course gives students the opportunity to practice science communication by creating oral presentations for their peers.
