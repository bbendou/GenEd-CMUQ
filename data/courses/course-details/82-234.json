With a focus on the Peoples Republic of China and its most recent development, the readings include literature, film, popular culture, environmental history, and new media.We will also read important theories as analytical tools by Rob Nixon, Karen Thornber, Ursula Heise, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Anna Tsing, William Cronon, etc. The undergrad seminar will examine a vast range of topics in literary and visual expressions. Each thematic topic is paired with a key concept in environmental humanities so that students can situate their study within the scholarship of environmental humanities. We will understand Chinese environmental literature from an intertextual and interdisciplinary perspective.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Future Materials", "slug": "future-materials", "id": 1546}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Frame East Asian environmental problems in a cultural and historical contextExplore US and global environmental issues from a comparative and planetary perspectiveAnalyze modern Chinese literaturevisual culture in the most cuttingedge works from environmental humanities Collaborate with other students to increase knowledge and understanding from their own distinctive cultural backgrounds Communicate effectively in class discussion and writing", "key_topics": "Chinese literature and visual culture; environmental humanities; environmentalism; environmental justice; ecocriticism; environmental history", "prerequisite_knowledge": "None\nAll materials have English translations; No Chinese language required.
