The core experience is writing a small Unixinspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator and on actual PC hardware if you wish.  Work is done in twoperson teams, and team programming skills source control, modularity, documentation are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock the course also surveys higherlevel OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned  to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2scomplement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.  Auditing  this course is usually full, and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept.
