In this course, we will explore the impact and cultural dimensions of migrations through the lens of Germanys minorities. By mapping the course of German postwar history, immigration and migration, we will establish the context for our probe into the lived experience of Germanys Turkish, Jewish, Black, East German, and refugee minorities. Examining, comparing, and historically situating these experiences and surrounding debates will allow us to address topical issues related to diversity, multiculturalism, racism, and citizenship that shape contemporary Germany. Appreciating the diversity of minority experiences will help students think more critically about the constructedness of identities. This discussionbased course is taught in English and open to all students.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1.
