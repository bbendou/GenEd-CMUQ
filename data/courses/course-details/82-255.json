BUT STILL, Kpop is either introduced in the mainstream media as a new phenomenon or as a dark industry while being assimilated into other Korean popular culture elements that have very different audiences.Even though the discourse around the Korean Wave is essential to understand how Kpop gained global exposure, it does not tell you the whole story. To understand the multiple facets of Kpop, it is necessary to take some distance from the Korean Wave and consider Kpop as a single entity. On the other hand, by overfocusing on the global attractivity of Kpop, we tend to forget about the national context, when it is crucial to understand where Kpop originates.Informed by a production and a reception focus and using an interdisciplinary approach that combines Area studies, Ethnomusicology, and Gender Studies, this seminar does not aim at teaching you exactly what Kpop is. Instead, it provides you with the tools to define it in your own way. Students will learn how to express their critical thinking through both nonacademic and academic writing. It engages students in critical readings of written and audiovisual texts, as well as allows them to practice writing as a recursive process of drafting and revision. Consider this seminar as a safe space where students use their interest whichever type of interest it could be in Kpop as a gateway to understanding its cultural conditions through engaging academic discussions.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students should be able to Reflect on their own background and experiences as a non Kpop fan and use thoseas a gateway to broader discussions.
