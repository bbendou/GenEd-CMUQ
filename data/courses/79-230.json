The course interrogates not only the histories of ideologies that led to revolution and violence in the modern history of Palestine and Palestinians and of Zionism and Israel, but also the very notions of conflict and peace. It examines ideas of state and nation as well as practices of Ottoman and then British imperialism and Zionist settler colonialism in the territory that became Palestine, then Eretz Israel, and now Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Throughout the semester, students will explore how these ideas and practices are linked to the development of violence, armed struggle and a myriad of nationalist and religiousnationalist ideologies as they came to be understood by Palestinian Arabs, Zionist settlers, Palestinian citizens of Israel, Islamists, and Israeli religiousnational groups. Students are tasked with considering the historical social, political, cultural, and religious implications of these discourses and practices. We will make use of documentary and other primary sources and texts, including poems, excerpts from literature, memoirs, film footage, posters, and other forms of media. By the end of the semester, students will be able to analyze and discuss the historical significance of the multifaceted ideologies and motivations held by actors involved in the armed struggle movements in Palestine and Israel, and the shifting nature of nationalisms as dependent upon locations, time periods, and understandings of history and politics. This course meets the Dietrich Gen Ed Intercultural and Global Inquiry requirement.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will identify the historical origins of contemporary revolts, violence, conflict, and war, as well as chart the changing demographics of Palestine and later, Israel.
