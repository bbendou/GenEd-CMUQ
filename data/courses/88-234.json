However, negotiation is best understood by analyzing the contextual environment in which the negotiation takes place. This class focuses on negotiations that take place across international borders and examining how the features of the negotiation environment drive the negotiation process and ultimately the results. We will show how features such as the historical relationships between the parties, the constituents and political environment, the cultural norms, alternatives to a negotiated agreement, linkages to future negotiations with other countries, whether the negotiation takes place openly or behind closed doors, and the psychological process will influence the negotiating agents, process, and outcomes. Note that this framework can be applied to any negotiation situation to shed light on what transpired during a negotiation and how an agreement ultimately was or was not reached.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students will be able to Assess the important contextual features of the negotiation environment that influence how international negotiations unfold and how they are or are not resolved.
