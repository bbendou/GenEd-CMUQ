In general, these courses are designed to give students some real research experience through work on a faculty project or lab in ways that might stimulate and nurture subsequent interest in research participation. Faculty and students devise a regular meeting and task schedule. Each Research Training course is worth 9 units, which generally means a minimum of about 9 workhours per week. These courses are offered only as electives i.e., they cannot be applied toward a college or major requirement, although the units do count toward graduation as elective units.
