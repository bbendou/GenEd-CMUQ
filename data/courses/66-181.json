Indeed, the protection of these essential rights in many ways drove and defined their successful rebellion from Britain.  This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first and arguably considered at the time as the most essential of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the free speech amendment to the Constitution.  This amendment guarantees every U.S. citizen five freedoms freedom of religion, speech, press, peaceable assembly, and the freedom to petition the government for redress of grievances.  This course examines the historical and philosophical roots of this key constitutional amendment, how it has been fleshed out and defined over time through case law, and the bases of some more recent critics of this amendments and current interpretations.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Characterize the challenges associated with the definition of human, especially as they relate to augmentative technologies and systems nuance the dynamic relationship of technology to humans using post and transhumanism as an interdisciplinary basis for inquiry.

These movements grapple with the positionality,\nmediation, and shrinking agency of humans within larger systems of technology and\nknowledge (posthumanism), and question who we are, what we are becoming, and,\nmost controversially, where we are going (transhumanism).
