This course takes their assertion seriously by examining the role of communicative practices in constructing race, from discourses around the NFL national anthem protests to dominant discussions around transnational and transracial adoption. Well look for common themes in the discourse around certain events and practices, asking why certain ideas or tropes are used and repeated, and what historical, social, cultural, and political associations inform these tropes that help them to perpetuate racial stereotypes in popular culture without overtly claiming racism. Students will practice thinking critically about everyday cultural narratives, and produce a final paper identifying the work one such set of narratives does to shape reality and create, reinforce, or perpetuate the construction of racial meanings.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Read, interpret, and evaluate scholarship on race in rhetorical studies and similar fields.
