This course asks students to recognize that many problems we encounter in our communities require an invested stakeholder, like ourselves, to conduct a careful investigation of perspectives and constraints before proposing a feasible solution that considers diverse stakeholders values and viewpoints. Students will learn how public problems are defined and argued in the proposal genre by reading a range of expert texts and analyzing a variety of sample proposals. Students will conduct various forms of social research email, interview, survey, andor observation to gain perspective on a problem and develop a solution mindful of others expertise and experience. Students will also synthesize relevant secondary research to rhetorically frame a proposal in ways that will compel their intended audience to take action. By the end of the course, students will write and present their own change proposal that identifies a communitybased problem, proposes a thoughtfullyresearched solution, and recommends a feasible plan for change in one of their own communities.

Taking two out of these three minis is one of the course options that students can choose to fulfill their First-Year Writing requirement. The other option is to take a full-semester course, normally 76-101. If you like the idea of a fresh start in the middle of the semester, taking two mini courses might be a good option for you. The minis offer students the opportunity to focus upon strategies for particular types of communication situations and target genres. By taking two minis, you will gain exposure to more than one kind of writing: arts & humanities-based (76-106), technical (76-107), and professional (76-108). You will also learn ways of adapting to new and different communication situations.
