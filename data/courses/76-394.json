This class explores the theory and practice of video essays as a mode of scholarly inquiry into film and media. We will study the roots of academic video essaysin, for instance, documentaries, foundfootage experiments, video art, and the essay filmas well as debates on the role of video essays in film and media research and education. But our primary focus will be to develop a creative research practice by making video essays in a variety of emerging genres e.g. supercut, epigraph, desktop documentary, deformative experiments. Students will take part in various forms of collaboration e.g. workshops, joint projects and will leave the course with a portfolio of work that includes a potentially publishable capstone video essay. If scheduling allows, we will welcome one or more awardwinning video essayists for a masterclass andor workshop. No experience with video editing is necessary to enroll in the course.
