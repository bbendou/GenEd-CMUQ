Such molecules are aromatic compounds and dienes. The synthesis of a variety of compounds derived from carbonyl containing molecules will be discussed. Overall, the course prepares students to think globally about a problem and teach them to device different approaches to solve it.

The sequence of topics may not be as shown. 1- Conjugated Unsaturated Systems, carbocation stability, electrophilic additions, Diels-Alder reactions; 2- Aromaticity, aromatic compounds, spectroscopic properties of aromatic compounds; 3- Reactions of aromatic compounds, electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, reduction of aromatic compounds; 4- Aldehydes and Ketones, nucleophilic addition, their synthesis, addition of alcohols, amines, ylides, and cianides; oxidation of aldehydes; 5- Carboxylic acids, synthesis of derivatives: ester, amides, anhydrides, acyl chlorides; carboxylic acids as nucleophiles. 5- Enols and Enolates, tautomerism; synthesis and reactions. 6- Conjugate addition of carbonyl compounds and condensation; Claisen condensation; aldol reactions; cyclizations. 7- Amines, basicity; synthesis, reactivity; derivatives. 8- Introduction to Carbohydrates, Lipids and Proteins.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Organic Chemistry I (09217) or Modern Organic Chemistry I (09219)", "assessment_structure": "Students will be assessed through three one-hour exams and a Final Exam; these will make 80% of the grade; the reminder 20% of the grade will be given by the average grade of five homework (out of 6 or 7).

To calculate your grade we will add all three one-hour exams (300 points) and three times the Final score (300 points); the two lowest scores will be dropped (400 points left). Your highest five scores for the homework (100 points, 20 points each) will be added. Total points: 500 (=100%). The final grade (A, B, etc.) will be straightforward: 90+ % = A; 80.0-89.9 % = B; 70.0-79.9 % = C; 60.0-69.9 % = D; all below this score will receive an R. Grades will not be curved.

The following on-line resource: https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/intro1.htm will be very useful.
