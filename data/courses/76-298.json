In both science and technology, the full value of the work can only be actualized when we use all the tools at our disposal to reach our intended audiences. Research supports the notion that stories and narratives increase interest in science and technology and are complementary to other forms of science communication. Storytelling can cut through information clutter, foreground key points, and collapse the distance between researchers and the communities they seek to benefit. This class will combine our inherent inclination toward story with the practical skills of organizing a narrative and shaping it through writing. Students will study effective examples of storytelling in science and technology, learn the writing vocabulary necessary to learn from those models, and practice these skills by writing about projects from their own academic and professional interests. Students will also learn how to adjust those skills across mediafrom writing to oral presentations to multimodal storytelling situations.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
