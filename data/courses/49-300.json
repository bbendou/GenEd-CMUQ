Teams will progress through three phases 1 identifying opportunities for new products or services, 2 understanding those opportunities through stakeholder research, value opportunity analysis, and competitive landscape assessment, then selecting one of which to focus, 3 conceptualizing the opportunity with the goal of meeting the value proposition. This course will combine lecture and studio activities including the generation of 2D visual representation skills and 3D lowfidelity physical modeling in support of course work.  An important part of this course is a design project that is carried out by interdisciplinary teams. In order to effectively contribute to their team, each student should have experience or coursework in at least one of the following design, the arts, engineeringtechnology, or business.  This course is reserved for junior and senior level students.
