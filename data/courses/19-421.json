Class time will include a combination of faculty and guest speaker lectures, discussion of issues, videos, and problem solving.  Students will review and edit Wikipedia entries on an energy policy topic of their choice, and then analyze policy options resulting in an executive summary or paper on that topic.  While the course has no prerequisites, students should feel comfortable with scientific and technical topics. Upon completion of this course, students should have a deeper and more strategic understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with emerging energy policies. Open to seniors.
