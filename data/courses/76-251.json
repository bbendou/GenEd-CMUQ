We will read stories, poems, novels, and creative nonfiction for inspiration, and students will create their own work often using the readings as models. In class, prompts will be offered for more writing, and students will share their work. The class is based on understanding that Creative Writing has the power to reshape how we see our past, present, and future. Just as importantly, through creative work we can reshape our ideas about ourselveswho we are, and who we are becoming, in the world. A good class for those interested in the intersection between justice and education. Half of the class will be composed of incarcerated people, and the other half will be Carnegie Mellon students.
