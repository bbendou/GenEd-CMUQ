The study of these questions is not only valuable for understanding the legal process, participating in it, or writing about it, but the practice of attributing responsibility is common in many social and institutional contexts beyond law, even in daily conversation. By examining a variety of legal trialsranging from highprofile criminal cases to routine accidentsyoull learn about the linguistic as well as the social, cultural, and political dimensions of accountability discourse, including how systemic inequalities related to race, class, gender, sexuality, and other identities shape attributions of responsibility. In discussionintensive sessions and through a series of writing assignments, youll not only develop your own strategies for advocating for or against responsibility in particular cases but youll cultivate the critical tools necessary to craft and evaluate rhetorical approaches to attributions of responsibility among professional peers, while reflecting on relevant conceptions of justice.
