We will view and analyze a selected group of films portraying four main issues in Hispanic history and society memory and oblivion, immigration and exile, marginalized identities throughout history, and the Hispanic world in globalization. An understanding of the sociopolitical context that these films aim to portray through indepth reading, analysis, discussion, and investigation will provide a thorough understanding of the complexities of various historic events, and opportunities and challenges faced by the Hispanic world.
