Within the course, we will discuss texts and evidence from multiple perspectives. We will examine how literary and cultural scholars write about texts defined broadly, how they make claims, provide reasoning, and use textual support to argue for particular ways of seeing cultural objects. Throughout the semester, students will draw upon prior strategies and develop new ones for close reading and for critical analysis in order to produce their own thesisdriven arguments about why texts matter. We will consider and write about the extent to which these reading strategies are relevant for other kinds of reading and analysis by comparing texts from a variety of different disciplinary contexts.

The other option is to take a full-semester course, normally 76-101. If you like the idea of a fresh start in the middle of the semester, taking two mini courses might be a good option for you. The minis offer students the opportunity to focus upon strategies for particular types of communication situations and target genres. By taking two minis, you will gain exposure to more than one kind of writing: arts & humanities-based (76-106), technical (76-107), and professional (76-108). You will also learn ways of adapting to new and different communication situations.
