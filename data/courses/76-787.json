We will learn about the distinction between Writing across the Curriculum and Writing in the Disciplines and challenges to providing integrated, high quality writing instruction across the university.  We will explore the implications of the wide variety of forms of academic writing for instruction in English classrooms, including high school and firstyear writing classrooms.  Assessments will include reading responses and a final paper reviewing research on writing in a specific writing context of your choosing.  Students enrolled in the course for six units will be expected to do additional readings and give an oral presentation.  Please note that in terms of time commitment, a 3unit mini will require approximately six hours per week three hours homework and three hours class meetings and a 6unit mini will require twelve hours per week.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 3}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
