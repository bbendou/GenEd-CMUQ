Students in this course will learn key concepts in mobile application development using Googles Flutter toolkit and Dart programming language, which allows apps to be compiled for both the Android and iOS platforms. In addition to course lectures, each student will complete a series of weekly lab exercises where they will build a variety of small mobile applications. Students will demonstrate course learning by working together in teams of 34 to create a new mobile application that meets a need that is unaddressed or poorly addressed in the current marketplace.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
