In the process of developing these applications, students will gain a strong understanding of mobile application development, mobilecentered design, the process of creating and testing innovative application design, and larger principles of software engineering. In weekly labs, students can choose either the SwiftiOS or KotlinAndroid track to complete course work, but lectures will primarily use Swift to illustrate larger points of software architecture and engineering.
