When historical accounts and the voices that tell them are marginalized, we may perhaps not see the fullest version possible.              In order to explore other, alternative accounts of France and the Revolution of 1789, we will rely on texts that recount versions of the revolution from different perspectives. Some voices to be investigated, besides a sampling of the most famous ones Louis XVI, MarieAntoinette, Philippe dOrlans, Marat, Danton, Robespierre... are those of Tussaud, Corday, de Gouges, de Stal, Sieys, and of the Girondins and the Montagnards in their civil war. We will examine pamphlets, posters, speeches, newspaper articles, satirical cartoons, memoires, art depicting the revolution, and literary works, with the goal of understanding multiple aspects of this seemingly larger than life historical event. Lastly, we will examine a supranatural telling of 1789, as another alternative history.
