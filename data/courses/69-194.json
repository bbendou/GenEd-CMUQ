This will require a fee, which has yet to be determined. Due to state laws and classroom hours requirements, all lectures are mandatory with very few exceptions. This class will meet on around 2 Saturdays, which will be announced on the first day of class. This class is also offered in two parts. The first part 69194 is offered during mini2 and the second part 69195 is offered during the full spring semester.
