The focus on the class is on the three core lenses used to study and advance the science and practice of business. We will study the mathematics of optimization, economics, and the behavior in and of organizations. These are the foundations of the disciplines of finance, accounting, marketing, ..., that follow in the curriculum. Over the course of the semester, we will tackle complex multifaceted business problems. Think of examples like, bikeshare and the shareeconomy, international trade and supply chain, AI and the impact on work. For each case, we will work to apply the three lenses. A pillar for the semester is that business problems are not siloed in narrow disciplines, we must draw resources from disciplines across the entire university. The second pillar of our class is solving all problems  across all of society  requires your understanding of business science. This course may use thirdparty course material that is not available for individual purchase from the publisher.
