This movement grew out of literary studies. It is neither identical with literary studies, nor opposed to literary studies. It is today one form that the study of literature or other cultural works may take. This course offers a theoretical genealogy of cultural studies, showing how and why its theories and practices emerged and developed. As a genealogy, the course does not assume that cultural studies has an essence or an origin. The texts and topics will reflect the heterogeneity of its emergence and development. The course does, however, embody what we see as several historical changes in cultural studies, from idealism to materialism, from mono to multiculturalism, and from high culture exclusiveness to democratic inclusivity. The course is not designed to teach approaches, but to explore and interrogate the founding assumptions of the academic project that you are being trained to join. Students should, by the end of the class, have a sense of where cultural studies came from and of the problems and possibilities raised by the theories it continues to invoke.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": "http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/index.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "A familiarity with the history and key texts of theory in literary cultural studies.
