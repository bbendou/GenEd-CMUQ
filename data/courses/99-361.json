Section A Learning about Learning will provide an introduction to the science of learning. Students will learn about the different ways that people learn, the factors that influence learning, and how to apply this knowledge to their own learning and in designing learning experiences. Section B Intelligent Environments is a handon, projectbased course that introduces students to the issues and challenges of creating workable, affordable, and adaptable intelligent environments.
