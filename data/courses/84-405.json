Throughout history, technological developments have hastened the evolution in the character, nature, and types of wars being fought. In the contemporary conflict environment, the prospect of largescale conflict between nearpeer states is converging and shifting rapidly, with proxy conflicts and threats typically posed by nonstate andor irregular actors and tactics interacting with great power competition and significant strategic realignments between the United States, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. In such an environment, hybrid actors and proxy groups continue to wage war in an asymmetric and irregular manner that relies on ambiguity, strategic surprise, innovative uses of technology, and deception, against the everpresent backdrop of the threat of fullscale global war. This course will examine and historically contextualize various new trends in warfare, including the weaponization of AI technologies, increasingly sophisticated cyber and information warfare operations, the effects of social media in democratizing the information space relevant to conflict, the development of violent nonstate actors with conventional military capabilities, and state support of mercenary forces to achieve strategic gains without attribution.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will learn how emerging technologies and demographic trends are affecting the way wars are being waged.", "key_topics": "This course will analyze recent trends in warfare and explore current/emerging trends, including the gray zone, new military technologies, cyber attacks, the role of AI in warfare, etc.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "While no prior knowledge is required, a general understanding of military history and warfare would be helpful; students would also benefit from being informed about current events in the area of international politics and global conflict.", "assessment_structure": "There will be extensive reading, assigned in-class discussant roles, multiple reading quizzes, and a student research presentation.
