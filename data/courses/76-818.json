In the process, we will explore how to put rhetoric and the body into conversation with one another and what methodological implications this conversation has for rhetorical studies more broadly. The goal of this course is to provide breadth rather than depth, with the assumption that most students, even those relatively familiar with body andor rhetorical theory, will approach rhetorical studies of the body as novices. Students will conduct their own research on a topic related to rhetorical studies of the body that also aligns with their professional and academic goals. Graduate students interested in research will benefit from this courses focus on theory and the professional genres central to rhetorical studies. Undergraduates students both majors and nonmajors will have the opportunity to examine how the body intersects with communication and writing contexts in their everyday public and professional lives.
