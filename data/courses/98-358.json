Discussing controversial issues will enhance the students abilities to think critically about the world around them.

The course provides students with a platform to voice their opinions and creates enlightening and intellectual discussions in which we will acknowledge and consider different sides of one topic. We will discuss controversial issues across disciplines such as media, international studies, political science and much more. Through this course, students will be able to sharpen their persuasive, argumentative and analytical skills as well as gather knowledge on issues that affect us today.
