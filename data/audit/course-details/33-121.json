Topics covered will include vectors, momentum, force, gravitation, oscillations, energy, quantum physics, center of mass motion, rotation, angular momentum, statistical physics, and the laws of thermodynamics. No computer experience is needed.  Examples illustrating basic principles being presented will be taken from physics, chemistry, and biology.
