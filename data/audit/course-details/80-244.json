To that end, well examine the processes fueling climate change, well look at who is responsible for these processes, and well try to determine whether any current proposal to deal with climate change is an effective, just response to the problem.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Natural Sciences", "slug": "natural-sciences", "id": 20}, {"name": "Environmental Science", "slug": "environmental-science", "id": 160}], "attributes": [{"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Learn some important moral theories, as well as some important objections they face.
