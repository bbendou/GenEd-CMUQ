Disease can be a tragic part of human life, a fact that is even more apparent in during a global pandemic. To understand how specific diseases like COVID19 or cancer affect the human body, and how modern medicine can tackle them, this course includes a fundamental study of the basic molecular biology, genetics, and cell biology that underlies disease. This is a topicsbased course, with topics chosen to cover aspects of biology and health that students are likely to encounter in their daily lives. The topics for summer 2022 will include COVID19, genome editing, and cancer. We will explore these topics from both a basic science and a modern medicine perspective. Students will gain the expertise to critically evaluate media reports about biology and health, and to ask the questions that will help them to make educated decisions in their lives.
