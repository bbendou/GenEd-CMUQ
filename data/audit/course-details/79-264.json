This almost always requires a process of simplification in which inconvenient details are forgotten or repurposed in the service of national agendas. The Tibet Question is a telling example. In this class, we investigate the historical relationship between China and Tibet from the 13th century through the present, and note the ways advocates on both sides of the Tibet Question have constructed historical narratives propaganda in support of their political positions. We will also discuss the prospects for a political solution and consider the lessons the Tibet Question may hold for understanding other outstanding historical disputes.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "A primary goal of all history courses is to develop the ability to think critically and creatively.
