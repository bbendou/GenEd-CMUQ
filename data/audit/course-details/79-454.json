The Argentine model has been replicated on other continents and in many settings and is modeled on the successful USA model of private ownership and operation of freight rail, which is generally considered a model for the world. Conversely, passenger rail in the USA almost disappeared while in the UK it has enjoyed a spectacular run with a doubling of ridership since the privatization of its railways in roughly the same era, i.e., the Thatcher years.  The UKs model has been replicated in various forms throughout Europe and beyond.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Starting with the development of the first USA and UK railways, students will gain a basic understanding of the industrys history and economics, with special attention to the last several decades at a global level.
