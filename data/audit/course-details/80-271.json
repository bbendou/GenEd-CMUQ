Subjective captures the distinctive features that characterize what it means to be a psychological subject. This includes the power to represent, to think, feel, sense and in general to be conscious. Subjective features seem radically different from the physical world of matter and forces, a world that seems meaningless, unthinking and nonconscious. How can the subjective be rooted in the objective We address this central philosophical problem by engaging philosophy with science. In this course, we will investigate thinking, sensing, imagining, dreaming, hallucinating, mindfulness and selfknowledge. As a result, we will explore how the subjective might be the objective.
