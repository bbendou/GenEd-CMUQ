The course will also provide an introduction to the history and development of rhythm games, audiovisual art, and experimental music practices. Instruction is a combination of lectures on various topics followed by handson p5.js programming exercises. Assignment will consist primarily of creative coding assignments where students with less programming background can build algorithmic thinking skills while more advanced coders will be able to apply their knowledge and build their portfolio. Collaborations are welcome on projects, especially between students from different backgrounds. Students with a background in any form of design, media arts, HCI, computer science, music, IDEATE, will be a good fit for the course. The course will be taught in p5.js, but students are free to explore other tools e.g. Unity, Max MSP for their projects. Students should be familiar with at least one of the following fields design, music, programming, or be committed to spend extra time learning outside of scheduled lecture times. Coding knowledge is strongly preferred but not a requirement as we will go through programming basics in the first few weeks.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Understanding the relationship between music, computation, and interaction.
