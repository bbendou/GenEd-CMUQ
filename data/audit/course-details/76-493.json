The course weaves together two forms of criticalcreative practice1 Curating film festivals  For this component of the class, we will focus on topics such as film festivals and public culture, the geopolitics of programming, the significance of location, the work of curation, various types of festivals e.g., activist, identitybased, industryadjacent, as well as practical matters of PR, community partnerships, fundraising, and scheduling.Guest speakers will include programmers from the Pittsburgh area, as well as from national and international festivals like Sundance. How are film festivals rooted in older ritual forms of gathering  What is the sociocultural purpose of a festival What kinds of events can they be What does it mean to collaborate on a program of films that resonate with one another, and to gather people together to watch them How do festivals both serve preexisting audiences and create them2 Analysis of speculative fiction in film  For this part of the class, students will consider what it means to imagine possible futures within a dystopian present. How do conventional SF tropes draw from histories of colonial conquest, migration, and racialization How have artists pushed the boundaries of sound and moving image to capture speculative visions of environmental collapse, multiple timelines, labor, and artificial intelligence Assignments may include weekly responses to screenings and readings, a mood reelpitch deck for a speculative fiction film or other screen media, and a critical analysis that can take written or audiovisual form i.e., a video essay.
