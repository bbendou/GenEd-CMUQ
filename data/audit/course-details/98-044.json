Unlike the weekly assignments, which are graded on completeness and effort, they will be graded on design and artistic merit.\n-Two or three times in a semester, you will give a short (two-minute) presentation about the flag that you have designed for that week's assignment. Your classmates will then give you comments and feedback on your design. Please make sure to attend class when you are scheduled to present.\n-The final exam will be a short Canvas quiz on the basics of flag design and terminology covered during the semester.\"", "relevance": "Flags are all around us.

Any method of creating an image of a flag is acceptable - markers and pens, a drawing app on a tablet, Microsoft Paint, or professional software like Inscape or Adobe Illustrator.
