Medium-stakes assignments: Weekly tasks aimed at applying each unit's skills and theory necessary for potential projects or for course project milestones. Each week will end with a group initiative that allows students to practice collaborative research. These weekly unit assessments will serve as white space for project creation and sharing of ideas (e.g. journal prompts). High-stake assignments: Final capstone project. This portfolio project contains both cumulative items from the semester, as well as a final contributory component that may take various forms, including a research paper. Given the novelty of these projects, they have the potential to be disseminated in various ways (e.g. undergraduate research publication or Meeting of the Minds posters).", "relevance": "Students will think reflectively about science as a process by engaging them in the analysis of how scientific knowledge and methodologies are represented in films and texts", "learning_resources": "movies and Text", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
