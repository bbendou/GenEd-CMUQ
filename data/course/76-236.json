But we also read fictionnovels and storiesthat tell us about imaginary worlds. Sometimes they are very much like our world, sometimes different. In this course well read classic novels like Charles Dickens Great Expectations or Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment up to contemporary ones like Station Eleven or Severance. We will consider how they represent the world, their use of literary forms, and how they lead us into their alterior world. We will also consider what they say about their culture and society. Do they make a statement about the world, or are they more for entertainment   This course is based on the InsideOut Prison Exchange Program, and will be taught at SCI Somerset, a nearby prison.  The course will include both outside students from CMU, as well as inside students at SCI Somerset. The course focuses on active participation and discussion between students. It runs from 230510 on Friday afternoon. CMU students will travel together by bus, leaving our campus at 1230 and returning by 630. To enroll, students in the course will submit a brief application and interview with faculty. The course is part of an exciting new initiative by CMU to bring education into Americas prisons.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "service learning", "id": 15, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "A beginning familiarity with the history of the novel and the ways that it works and represents the world.", "key_topics": "History of the novel", "prerequisite_knowledge": "None, though should have interest in fiction", "assessment_structure": "Three short papers, as well as presentations and in-class writing", "relevance": "Will introduce analysis of literature and ways that representation works in our culture", "learning_resources": "Canvas page and some linked readings", "extra_time_commitment": "Read description of \"Inside/Out\" service learning, https://www.insideoutcenter.org/prospective-students.html .
