And while the story of Viennas cultural and political turmoil is interesting, it probably would not command our attention today were it not for its role as the birthplace of Modernism. In an effort to understand todays intellectual environment, therefore, we will examine Vienna before the collapse of the AustroHungarian Empire in 1918. We will be looking at a huge and at times confusing canvas which by necessity includes almost every aspect of culture. We will start with politics and history and move on through art, architecture, crafts, psychoanalysis, literature, music, and philosophy. We will be looking at art nouveau buildings and furniture, reading literature, viewing films, and listening to recordings  and we will build 3D models on a digital map which will help us understand how the different arts were all connected and influenced each other.
