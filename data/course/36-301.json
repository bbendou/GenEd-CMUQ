The need to understand and document human rights issues is at the center of the most pressing current events. From threats to democracy and civil rights to work holding perpetrators of mass harm accountable in legal proceedings to efforts to quantify and advance economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights, making human rights violations visible is fundamental to achieving a more just world. We will begin with an overview of the history of human rights, the main philosophical and political debates in the field, and the most relevant organizations, institutions, and agreements. We will then delve into specific cases that highlight methodological opportunities and challenges, including the identification of mass atrocity victims, the disappeared, and missing migrants efforts to estimate civilian casualties in war the documentation of police brutality and other human rights violations with smartphones as well as the use of satellite imagery and drone footage for the documentation of genocide, environmental rights, and war crimes. We will critically assess the technical challenges that arise in each context and how the human rights and scientific communities have responded. After reviewing these cases, we will conclude by reflection on why the documentation of human rights actually matters and what happens to evidence once it is gathered. Students will then take what theyve learned and do two multidisciplinary group projects, one involving the document of a rights violation in Western Pennsylvania and the other involving an international situation. Assignments include an essay, a data analysis assignment, and a group project that include a written component, quantitative andor qualitative data analysis, and a presentation.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "service learning", "id": 15, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "This course is a direct result of our desire to make the work that we do within the Center for Human Rights Science more accessible and relevant to undergraduates at Carnegie Mellon who have, or want to develop, skills and expertise that can support the work of the human rights community.
