The information age is characterized by the ability of individuals to transfer information freely and have instant access to knowledge that would have been difficult or impossible to find previously. The digitization of information and the rise of electronic media have confounded the traditional publishing houses who have struggled to find their footing in this new environment. The information age has also provided new forms of information dissemination and inexpensive means of selfpublishing and ondemand publishing. This course examines the history of the publishing industry in western society including books, magazines, and newspapers. It then looks at the disruptive effect that the information age has had in this industry and at the new publishing paradigms that are evolving to take advantage of digital media. The course also includes lab experiences using Adobe InDesign to help students develop skills in designing and preparing pieces for publication by a variety of media. The lab experiences culminate in an independently published book that is written, designed, and assembled entirely by the students in this course. The book stands as a showcase for the research and journalistic skills of the students, as well as, a clear demonstration of the students proficiency in the content and skills taught in this course. Although this course is open to undergraduates of all class years, it is aimed at 3rd and 4th year students. No prerequisites. The course has been previously listed as number 70194.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Ageing", "slug": "ageing", "id": 1602}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
