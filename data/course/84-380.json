This course will situate current events in the historical context of grand strategy during and after the Cold War, as well as a wider understanding of how countries determine their goals and seek to pursue them through a combination of diplomatic, economic, military, and political means. Students will explore the connection between domestic and foreign affairs and how all these issues relate to current U.S. strategy toward a rising China, an assertive Russia, and socalled rogue states like Iran and North Korea.
