F24 The United States prison system continues to grow, with nearly 2 million incarcerated people and over 6,000 prisons, jails, and detention centers nationwide. Its expansion disproportionately impacts impoverished communities, people of color, and LGBTQ people, as it is connected to a fraught history. Throughout this class, we will engage with novels, memoirs, letters, essays, and poetry written by incarcerated or formerly incarcerated people to understand the critiques they wage against the carceral state. We begin with early depictions of penitentiaries, then turn to political responses to imprisonment throughout the twentieth century, and close with literature about the contemporary carceral state. In studying representations of the US prisons development over time, we will ask How do prison writers bear witness to and resist the prisonindustrial complex Readings might include works by Reginald Dwayne Betts, Jimmy Santiago Baca, Assata Shakur, Malcolm X, George Jackson, Jack Henry Abbot, and Chester Himes.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Ecology", "slug": "ecology", "id": 248}, {"name": "Scientific Writing", "slug": "scientific-writing", "id": 320}, {"name": "Fiction", "slug": "fiction", "id": 1455}, {"name": "Shaping", "slug": "shaping", "id": 1604}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students will be able to apply historical and contemporary theories prison to readings demonstrate an understanding of how genre and form impact, meaning, and representation incarceration interrogate the representation of law, power, and incarceration across prose forms develop thoughtful and evidencebased arguments about literary forms using relevant theoretical frameworks and cultural criticism examine the impact of incarceration and perception of crime on communities", "key_topics": "critical carceral studies, literature, mass incarceration, law, resistance, abolition", "prerequisite_knowledge": "No prior knowledge necessary", "assessment_structure": "Short response papers throughout the class, group & individual presentations, participation, a final paper/project", "relevance": "The course is open to all students but especially those who are interested in taking courses with the Prison Education Project as it shifts the locus of knowledge and knowledge production to people who have been impacted by the prison system.
