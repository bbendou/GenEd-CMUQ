Throughout the course, students will adopt a usercentered approach, utilizing essential usability methods to gain insights into the information needs, behaviors, and preferences of users. They will develop the ability to identify and rectify usability issues on websites.Additionally, students will delve into the principles of online information design, encompassing topics such as information architecture, navigation, and effective labeling. In the required lab section of the course, students will gain handson experience with core web technologies, including HTML and CSS, to shape and style web content. They will also gain an understanding of JavaScript and APIs, which play a pivotal role in integrating data and services into websites.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "lab component", "id": 11, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students in this course will be able to 1 develop a vocabulary for discussing information architecture and content strategydesign, 2 use usercentered methods to plan and design a largecomplex information space, and 3 practice writing a report that summarizes the usercentered information design process and provides recommendations.", "key_topics": "Information Architecture, Online Information Design, Usability Methods, Design Documentation", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Undergraduate students should have taken 76270 Writing for the Professions or 76271 Introduction to Professional & Technical Writing, and 51261 or 51262 Communication Fundamentals, or 76391 Document & Information Design.\n\nGraduate students should have taken 76870 Professional & Technical Writing and 76791 Document & Information Design.", "assessment_structure": "Students will be assessed based on the quality of their reports.
