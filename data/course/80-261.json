We will focus on the problems encountered in trying to give an adequate account of the our knowledge of the external world, the structure of our minds, and the nature and limitations of human knowledge. The scope of our investigation will extend to the nature of mathematical knowledge, to thought experiments in both science and philosophy, and to nativism vs. empiricism issues in contemporary cognitive science and moral theory.
