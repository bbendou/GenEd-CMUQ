Over the course of the semester, students will design and perform multiple modern experiments and quantitatively analyze the results of these experiments. During this course students will also have an opportunity to use techniques learned during the course to experimentally answer an open question.  Designing the experiments will require students to think critically about the biological context of the experiments as well as the necessary controls to ensure interpretable experimental results.  During this course students will gain experience in many aspects of scientific research, including sequencing DNA, designing and performing PCR for a variety of analyses, maintaining cell cultures, taking brightfield and fluorescent microscopy images, developing methods for automated analysis of cell images, communicating results to peers and colleagues.
