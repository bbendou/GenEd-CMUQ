Students will create effective communications, ethically incorporating sources while establishing their own voice and contribution to an academic community.  They will also identify strategies to critically engage and analyze scholarly texts.  Skills acquired in this course will help prepare students for participation in their disciplinary discourse communities in graduatelevel studies and beyond.
