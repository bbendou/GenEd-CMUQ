This course is designed not only to educate but also to actively engage students in the analysis of some of the most divisive and challenging issues facing the nation today, including the 2nd Amendment, abortion rights, crime, and immigration policy.   Throughout the semester, students will engage in a variety of learning activities including critical readings, indepth discussions, and live debates. These components are structured to encourage a deep understanding of the multifaceted nature of American political divides. Students will be challenged to explore and argue from viewpoints different from their own, fostering a broader perspective and empathy in understanding opposing arguments.  This course offers students a platform to deeply engage with the current political climate, understand the roots of American political divides, and develop skills essential for civic engagement and discourse. This course is ideal for students with interests in political science, history, law, social justice, and those looking to gain a deeper understanding of the complex political landscape of the United States and its implications for justice and injustice in society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics", "id": 1191}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students will have a deepened understanding of the complex forces driving political polarization.
