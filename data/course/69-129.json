It is intended for women only because it is believed that the presence of males in class other than instructors or other authorized persons can alter the emotional and physical responses of women to class material and thereby hinder their ability to reach course objectives.  It is of the utmost importance that women be able to maximize their opportunity to learn in the company of likeminded students.  The core of the course is based upon the principles of the Rape Aggression Defense System R.A.D.which was conceived and developed by Larry N. Nadeau.  His goal in developing R.A.D. is also its motto  To develop and enhance the options of selfdefense, so they may become viable considerations to the woman who is attacked.  This course is composed of three sections  risk reduction principles, physical defense techniques, and simulation.  Risk reduction principles include a thorough review of personal selfawareness  the environment, whether in the home, neighborhood, or unfamiliar community.  Physical defense techniques include the introduction to bodily strikes with hands, kicks with the feet, and defenses against grabs  holds.  Simulation is the activity that attempts to incorporate, via physical demonstration, all emotional  physical techniques that have been taught through the acting out of scenarios involving instructors paddedprotected as attackers, and students paddedprotected responding to the assault.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "grade_option": {"name": "Pass/Fail", "short_name": "P", "never_graded": false, "is_pass_fail": true, "is_audit": false, "id": 4}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
