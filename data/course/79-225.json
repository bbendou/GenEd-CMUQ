It will cover such topics as states vs. stateless societies, urbanization, transSaharan trade, Islamization, European interaction, the transAtlantic slave trade, colonialism, cash crops, missionaries, nationalism, and independence. Students will understand how this dynamic region changed over time as a result of internal factors, such as state formation, as well as external factors, interaction with Muslim and European traders. Students will also be exposed to the variety of sources used by historians to reconstruct West Africas rich history. The course will use historical films by some of West Africas most famous filmmakers, such as Ousman Sembene, to illustrate the diversity of the region and its historical change over time. Course includes two class meetings and mandatory film screenings on Wednesdays from 640930pm.  This course fulfills Dietrich Colleges Contextual Thinking general education requirement.
