Philosophers address them by producing intricate and often beautiful arguments. In this course, you will assess those arguments and produce your own. You will learn how to have challenging, productive, and respectful discussions across political and moral differences. You will learn to think like a philosopher  to strip an argument presented in prose to its essentials and plainly expose its structure. This course will improve the clarity and rigor of your own thinking and writing. It will put you in a position to make progress on hard questions like those mentioned above. And it will improve your ability to crisply convey your ideas  an ability that will serve you well not just in class, but also in daily life.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "https://youtu.be/XVeKvfzVuO4", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "1 Learn about why people hold different political and moral views to your own, how to talk productively with people whose beliefs you reject, how to consider others arguments in an unbiased way, and how to think things through for yourself. 2 Recognize the diversity of values that inform others moral, political, and philosophical beliefs. 3 Parse the logical structures of argumentative texts identify conclusions, premises and how they compose to form reasons and objections identify and evaluate inferences. 4 Construct compelling arguments that defend interesting conclusions, not obviously answered in lectures or assigned readings, using clear and effective logical structures. 5 Predict potential objections to your arguments and learn how to acknowledge and address them. 6 Learn when a priori methods are appropriate and when empirical research is necessary. 7 Apply analytic skills to explore any question where reasons and objections are provided.
