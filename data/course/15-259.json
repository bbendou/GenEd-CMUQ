In areas such as artificial intelligence and computer science theory, probabilistic reasoning and randomization are central. Within networks and systems, probability is used to model uncertainty and queuing latency. This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation. The course has 3 parts  Part I is an introduction to probability, including discrete and continuous random variables, heavy tails, simulation, Laplace transforms, ztransforms, and applications of generating functions. Part II is an indepth coverage of concentration inequalities, like the Chernoff bound and SLLN bounds, as well as their use in randomized algorithms.  Part III covers Markov chains both discretetime and continuoustime and stochastic processes and their application to queuing systems performance modeling. This is a fastpaced class which will cover more material than the other probability options and will cover it in greater depth.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Analyze probabilities and expectations using tools such as conditioning, independence, linearity of expectations.
