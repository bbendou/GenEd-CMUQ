Sometimes these phenomena spark our imagination and affirm our confidence in a better future. In other instances, they create fear and generate protests over the risks new technologies and scientific ideas pose to prevailing social, cultural, economic, and political orders. In this course we will examine the complex dynamics in the relationships between science, technology, and society. Towards this end we will engages with questions such as How do we decide who an expert is To what extent do scientists have an obligation to consider the social and ethical consequences of their work Is public education about science and technology sufficient for addressing social concerns about risk and controversial scientific ideas We will grapple with these and other questions by exploring public debates including conflicts over global warming, vaccinations, and the AIDS crisis. With the help of analytical theories from sociology, rhetoric, and public policy, we will develop a framework for thinking about argument and the dynamics of the relationship between science, technology, and the public. We will also look to these fields for tools to assess public debate and to complicate andor affirm prevailing theories about the relationship between science and society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Sciences & Technologies", "slug": "sciences-technologies", "id": 10}, {"name": "Social Sciences", "slug": "social-sciences", "id": 12}, {"name": "General Sciences", "slug": "general-sciences", "id": 162}, {"name": "Political Sciences", "slug": "political-sciences", "id": 1260}, {"name": "Sociology", "slug": "sociology", "id": 1261}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "To have a deeper appreciation of the challenges faced by scientists and nonexpert audiences when they interface with one another", "key_topics": "rhetoric, science, public sphere, vaccination debate, AIDS denialism, climate change, scientific expertise", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "assignments", "relevance": "It helps students understand the complexity in the relationship between science and society", "learning_resources": "the course Canvas will include readings, reference materials, and links to websites", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
