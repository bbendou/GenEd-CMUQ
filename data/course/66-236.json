Students will build up their ability to recognize and apply diagnostic criteria understand key principles and terms and take part in an informed discussion about ways of seeing, and creating interventions for environmental problems as social and scientific challenges. There are no prerequisites for this course. Students will develop skills and apply concepts to different scenarios of environmental crisis.
