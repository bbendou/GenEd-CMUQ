By examining cities as a lens, this sequence of weekend courses encourages students to examine cities as a system for discussing social processes being built and rebuilt. With an interdisciplinary focus, the course invites experts from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and relevant fields more broadly.  This iteration of the course will explore such topics as the role cities can have on climate change, lowemission growth and clean energy the importance of access to resources the need for sustainable transportation the practices of sustainable consumption among others.
