We will also cover slightly more advanced topics including Markov Chains, hypothesis testing, and maximumlikelihood estimation. The remaining part of the semester will be devoted to introducing machine learning concepts such as supervisedunsupervised learning, model identification, clustering, expectation maximization, etc. Students should be familiar with basic calculus, linear algebra.  Although students in 18465 will share lectures with students in 18665, students in 18465 will receive distinct homework assignments, distinct projects, and distinct exams from the ones given to students in 18665.
