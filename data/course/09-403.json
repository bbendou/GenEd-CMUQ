The ongoing epidemic of opiate addiction, arising both from overprescription of pain killers and recreational use of heroin, has been widely reported and continues to rise at alarming rates, ravaging our urban and rural communities. In this course, we will explore the complicated role of chemistry in this epidemic, including the good elucidating mechanisms of action, development of clinically useful and safe opiates and nonopiate pain killers and the bad design and synthesis of increasingly addictive opiates. We will also discuss ethical questions faced by the pharmaceutical industry that develops, markets and sells opiates, the medical community that prescribes opiates, and the government agencies charged with regulating these activities. Students who complete this course will emerge with a broad understanding and perspective on an issue that is of great scientific and societal importance. 3 hrs. lec.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Medical And Health", "slug": "medical-and-health", "id": 19}], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Upon completion of this course, students shouldBe familiar with endogenous opioid peptides and other neurotransmitters, how they interact with specific receptor proteins in the brain, and what biological effects these interactions have.Recognize the core structural features of addictive substances that contribute to their biological function.Understand the differences between agonists and antagonists.Recognize how metabolism and biodistribution affect the addictive potential of drugs.Be able to discuss the roles of the pharmaceutical industry, medical professionals and government agencies in the in the regulation, marketing and distribution of both legal and illegal addictive substances.", "key_topics": "The course provides a holistic view of addiction to opiates and other substances.
