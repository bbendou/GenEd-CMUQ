In this seminar, we will implement Hillocks philosophy by learning to think about our pedagogy as a research project, asking such questions as:   What do students need to learn about writing? Are our classes helping students gain these skills?  Are there particular pedagogical strategies that seem more or less effective than others?  Do new advances in technology offer us new ways to improve our instruction?  How do students use (or not use) the knowledge they gain in writing classes in future contexts?    What unique needs do various groups of students have (e.g. students with learning disabilities, students from different linguistic or cultural backgrounds) that our pedagogy should work to accommodate?  We will read recent research seeking to answer these questions and practice producing research of our own.  We will learn how to identify researchable questions, develop methods and research designs for answering those questions, and dig through the evidence we collect to come to more nuanced understandings of the questions we sought to answer.    Throughout the course, students will complete a series of mini projects that will introduce them to a variety of research methodologies.  These projects will lead into a final research project of students own design.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Pedagogy", "slug": "pedagogy", "id": 115}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
