It familiarizes the student with the basic structures and processes of American government. The main theoretical tools are spatial models of political decision making, and models of collective action problems. The course focuses on politics and government in the United States, but explicit comparisons are made with politics in other countries. Grading is usually based on two midterm exams and a final exam, as well as a short writing assignment, several quizzes and homework.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Politics", "slug": "politics", "id": 1191}, {"name": "Political Sciences", "slug": "political-sciences", "id": 1260}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
