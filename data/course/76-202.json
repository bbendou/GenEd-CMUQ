Today, we commonly encounter portraits of smart people as experts, geniuses, or nerds, variously cast as technovisionaries or hyperspecialized experts, and often struggling with social difficulties. What do these contemporary portraits tell us about the central if unusual role that intellectuals play in our culture And how have significant transformations in key social institutions like higher education and the mass media shaped our conceptions of, and attitudes towards, intellectuals and intellectual life  To explore these questions, well look at the history of intellectuals in literature and culture over roughly the last century, touching on a series of key moments and milieux from early portrayals of bohemia in novels like The Sun Also Rises 1926 to the autobiographical writings of controversial political figures like George Orwell and Ernesto Che Guevara, and popular genres like the campus novel and college films.  Along the way, well also read a number of critical and scholarly writings on the subject such as Edward Saids Representations of the Intellectual 1994, as well as essays from critics like Karl Mannheim, Antonio Gramsci, Simone de Beauvoir, Grant Farred and C. Wright Mills.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Big Game", "slug": "big-game", "id": 1939}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
