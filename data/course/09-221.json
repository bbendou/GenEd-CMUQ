You will gain a strong foundation in the more traditional wet chemical methods of analysis such as titration and gravimetric analysis and modern instrumental methods of analysis including ultravioletvisible spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, microwave digestion and highpressure liquid and gas chromatography. These are important tools for analysis and you will have a good working knowledge of those techniques.2. You will begin your Carnegie Mellon training in experimental design. Not only should you be able to use a technique in the particular situation that we have prescribed, but also you want to understand its utility in a broader context. This in the end is what will prove much more useful to you in the future. In what situations might the method prove useful What are the constraints and in general how would the analysis be performed 3. You will also gain experience in written and oral technical communication. 4. You will receive training that satisfies the university requirement for certification in laboratory safety and chemical waste handling.", "key_topics": "lab safety; written and oral communication skills; \"traditional wet chemical methods pf analysis such as titrations, gravimetric analysis and column chromatography; instrumental methods of analysis such as visible spectrophotometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy, high-pressure and gas chromatography", "prerequisite_knowledge": "The prerequisite for this course is 09-106, Modern Chemistry II.
