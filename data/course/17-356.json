The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local midsize companies to internal startups from multinational tech giants.  However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges.  These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external nontechnical stakeholders.  This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers. This is an engineeringfocused course no entrepreneurship background is required or expected.
