The material in this course and in 36235 Probability and Statistical Inference I is organized so as to provide repeated exposure to essential concepts the courses cover specific probability distributions and their inferential applications one after another, starting with the normal distribution and continuing with the binomial and Poisson distributions, etc. Topics specifically covered in 36236 include the binomial and related distributions, the Poisson and related distributions, and the uniform distribution, and how they are used in point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. Also covered in 36236 are topics related to multivariate distributions marginal and conditional distributions, covariance, and conditional distribution moments. All discussion is supplemented with computerbased examples and exercises e.g., visualization and simulation. Given its organization, the course is only appropriate for those who first take 36235, and thus it is currently open only to statistics majors primary, additional, dual and minors, as well as to CS majors using both 36235 and 36236 to complete their probability requirement. All others are directed to take 36226. A grade of C or better in 36236 is required in order to advance to 36401.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be able to calculate probabilities using known and unknown parameters, describeidentifytransformmanipulate probability distributions, and work with random variables.
