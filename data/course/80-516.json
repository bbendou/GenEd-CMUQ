A number of researchers have been recognized with the Turing Award to Pearl in 2012 the Nobel Prize to Granger in 2003 and to Sims in 2011. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the causal view may facilitate understanding and solving various machine learning or artificial intelligence problems such as transfer learning, semisupervised learning, disentanglement, and adversarial vulnerability.   This course is concerned with understanding causality, learning causality from observational data, and using causality to tackle a class of learning problems. We will particularly focus on two key problems in causality. One is causal discovery. It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make this statement more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal influences may take place between the underlying hidden variables, and what we measure may be their reflections so we will also see how to find the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations by analyzing measured variables. Its implication in unsupervised deep learning will be discussed. The other is how to properly make use of causal information. This includes identification of causal effects, counterfactual reasoning, improving machine learning in light of causal knowledge, and forecasting in complex environments, and we will investigate how the causal perspective helps in domain adaptation, imagetoimage translation, and deep reinforcement learning.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students are expected to 1 understand how causality is different from association and why it is useful, 2 get familiar with probability theory, graphical models, causalityrelated concepts and principles, and emerging approaches to causal discovery from observational data, 3 see why and how the causal view helps in solving machine learning and artificial intelligence problems, and 4 gain the ability to do independent causalityrelated research in their own disciplines.", "key_topics": "Estimating causality from observational data, identification of causal effects, unsupervised machine learning, causal approaches to advanced machine learning and AI problems, history of modern causality research.", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Students are expected to have taken at least one class in statistics, probability theory, or machine learning.", "assessment_structure": "3 problem sets (worth 50%).
