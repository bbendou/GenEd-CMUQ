Historical analysis of the Holocaust will examine how and why it came about, placing it within the frameworks of modern German history, European AntiSemitism, and the Second World War. The course will cover the history of the National Socialist party and ideology of Adolf Hitler. We will trace the rapid radicalization and intensifying violence of Nazi policies against Jews during the first two years of the war.  We will discuss how historians explanations of the Holocaust have been shaped by the mountain of new evidence that has been discovered since 1945. Cultural analysis will examine the everevolving place of the Holocaust within German, Jewish, and Eastern European postwar cultures, and it will consider the ways that writers, filmmakers, and other cultural producers have understood the challenges posed by the Holocaust in the context of their own time and cultural milieu.This course fulfills Dietrich Colleges Contextual Thinking general education requirement.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Historical European", "slug": "historical-european", "id": 1148}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Our primary course goals will include 1.

This course will place the Holocaust in the European context of Nazi Germany's wartime allies, on the one hand, and its occupied territories, on the other. What role did, for example, Fascist Italy play in the Holocaust? To what extent did local people in, for example, occupied France or dismembered Poland collaborate with or, instead, resist Nazi extermination policies? How was postwar literature about the Holocaust shaped by memories of collaboration and resistance?\n\nMoreover, we will consider what was unique about the Holocaust as a genocide as well as discuss whether and how it shares features of other genocides of the twentieth century. Was the Holocaust a civilizational break that places it beyond comparison, or can it be compared to other crimes against humanity? Such debates are also central to the question as to how the Holocaust has altered notions of Western culture and civilization.", "learning_resources": "The collections at Hunt Library; the film library; Canvas (where many of the readings will be located); the Kanopy film database; the two instructors; students will probably have to purchase one book, which will, however, also be available at the library.", "extra_time_commitment": "None, with one visit to the Carnegie Museum during regularly scheduled class-time."}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
