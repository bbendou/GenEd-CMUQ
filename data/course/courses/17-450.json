In this class, you will learn how to identify and find problems in your code. You will learn to read, parse, organize, and transform data. We will teach you to write code collaboratively and refine your programs so others can use them.The course will be a mixture of lecture and guided exercise with a recitation focused on hands on instruction.  In this course, students are expected to have been exposed to some basic programming concepts, such as variables, ifstatements, loops, and arrays.  However, students are not expected to have extensive programming experience. This course is not appropriate for students that have completed more than two courses involving programming. We expect students in this class to have diverse backgrounds and experience. Some students will be selftaught, while others will have taken a programming course such as 02201, 15110, 95898, or the librarys Software Carpentry workshop.
