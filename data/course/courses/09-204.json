Today's professional chemist spends countless hours in meetings, giving technical seminars, speaking to community groups, writing manuscripts for peer-reviewed journals and proposals for funding agencies, and preparing reports for supervisors. Those with chemistry degrees also pursue careers in non-research areas such as patent law, consulting, engineering, technical writing and the health professions. The common thread connecting these disparate disciplines and activities is communication, both written and oral. Beginning to build skills in professional communication will help prepare students to compete for summer internships, fellowships, employment and post-graduate programs.", "learning_resources": "Instructor's notes, readings and online videos will supplement in-class discussions.", "extra_time_commitment": "Students can expect to spend 2-3 hours per week (outside of class) reading course materials and working on assignments.
