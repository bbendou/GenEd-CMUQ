He was an enthusiastic follower of Isaac Newton, and his approach to fundamental philosophy was what would robotics be like from the viewpoint of the robot   From that starting point, he investigated what would have to be the case for the robot to know anything about its environment.  The resulting critical philosophy defined the relevant philosophical vocabulary for generations of prominent mathematicians and scientists into the 20th century, and is pivotal background both for both the analytic and the continental schools of philosophy.
