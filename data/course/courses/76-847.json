It seems that each generation has a different take on their meanings and implications. Early criticism weighed their \"beauties\" and \"flaws,\" and more recently their place in intellectual and social life has been analyzed by deconstructive, historical, psychoanalytic, marxist, and feminist commentary. In the seminar, we will read six plays (one comedy, one history, one \"problem play,\" one romance, and two tragedies) each accompanied by an essay proposing a particular theoretical position and some related criticism. Students will be honing their skills as readers of some of the most complex and challenging texts in the English language and simultaneously learning to write criticism of their own.  This seminar is not an introduction to Shakespeare; it is designed for students who have thought seriously about some of the plays (studied at the college level, acted in or directed productions, or the like) and wish to broaden and deepen their understanding. It is not limited to English and Drama majors. Regular attendance and participation (including occasional in-class writing) are required. Everyone will present a \"position statement\" to the seminar and submit two prepared papers. Grads and undergrads will work together every week for three hours; grad students will meet for an extra hour each week to discuss additional readings and prepare conference-ready seminar papers.", "student_sets": [], "offering_tags": [], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Comedy", "slug": "comedy", "id": 1757}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
