But most problems arent so simple. Most of the problems we encounter require careful investigation and research so that we might propose solutions that connect with others to make change. In this 76101 class one of two minis students can choose to fulfill their FYW requirement, we will learn how public problems are defined and argued across a range of texts, including proposals, oped genres, and white papers. By analyzing a range of proposal texts, we will identify the different kinds of legwork necessary to write a successful proposal, arguably one of the most challenging aspects of writing a persuasive recommendation for change. We will examine how writers unpack problems rhetorically and use evidence to argue solutions for different stakeholders who may not share common values. We will learn strategies for evaluating and synthesizing data from existing research to use in a proposal argument. By the end of the course, students will write their own proposal that recommends a solution and a feasible plan for solving a real problem.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/english/academic-programs/writing-and-communication/index.html", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Care Planning", "slug": "care-planning", "id": 67}, {"name": "Picking", "slug": "picking", "id": 1948}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will engage with meaningful communication projects that enable them to build strong rhetorical reasoning skills and powerful writing and communication strategies.

Taking two out of these three minis is one of the course options that students can choose to fulfill their First-Year Writing requirement. The other option is to take a full-semester course, normally 76-101. If you like the idea of a fresh start in the middle of the semester, taking two mini courses might be a good option for you. The minis offer students the opportunity to focus upon strategies for particular types of communication situations and target genres. By taking two minis, you will gain exposure to more than one kind of writing: arts & humanities-based (76-106), technical (76-107), and professional (76-108). You will also learn ways of adapting to new and different communication situations.
