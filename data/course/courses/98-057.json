Topics include the history of the field such as the work of Coxeter, Grnbaum, and Schlfli their combinatorial structure as abstract polytopes classes of polytopes e.g. regulars, uniforms, and nobles operations on polytopes including truncations, products, and conjugations connections to group theory, such as Coxeter groups and the monodromy group connections to topology via simplicial complexes more recent developments, e.g. generalizations to hypertopes and the polytope rendering software Miratope. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to join the Polytope Discord, some of whose members are conducting research in the field. The course will reference Abstract Regular Polytopes McMullen, Schulte and Geometric Regular Polytopes McMullen. The major assignments are an individual writeup on a polytope of the students choice and a group presentation on an active area of polytope research.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Define the various notions of polytope that appear in mathematics and explain the pros and cons of eachUnderstand operations on polytopes and how they arise from other mathematical structures such as groupsBe able to recognize when polytopes may be applicable in future studiesLearn to use Miratope to manipulate and render polytopesBecome introduced to the Polytope Discord community", "key_topics": "This is a broad course that will study polytopes from many perspectives, including combinatorics, group theory, topology, and history.
