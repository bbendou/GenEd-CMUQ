This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such as decision tree learning, neural networks, statistical learning methods, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The course covers theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, and Occams Razor. Programming assignments include handson experiments with various learning algorithms. This course is designed to give a graduatelevel student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning. 10301 and 10601 are identical.
