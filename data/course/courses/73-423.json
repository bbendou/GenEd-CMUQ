Accurate forecasts are critical to robust organizational decisionmaking. This course will introduce students to modern methods for forecasting in economic and business applications. Topics covered include Bayesian, statistical, and online learning approaches to forecast construction and assessment, univariate and multivariate time series models and algorithms, and principled combination of multiple methods and data sources along with subject matter expertise to improve performance. Methods will be motivated by applications in macroeconomics, technology, marketing, and finance, with cases drawn from forecasting processes in a variety of business and government organizations. Students will implement forecasting methods in R, including in a real data forecasting competition.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Upon successful completion of this course, students should be able to 1 Develop familiarity with a suite of forecasting models and methods to be able to implement them in practice assess their benefits and drawbacks and tailor the choice and implementation to particular application 2 Understand and apply principles of decision theory to evaluate and improve forecasting approaches 3 Draw on practical applications of forecasting by individuals and organizations in business and economic environments and 4 Apply modern software environments, including the R programming language, to reliably and reproducibly apply best forecasting practices", "key_topics": "Business Decision Making, Forecasting, Time Series", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Basic R skills, multi-variate calculus, and basic probability.", "assessment_structure": "Subject to change: problem sets; monthly forecast reports;, participation; and final report and presentation.", "relevance": "This course is for students interested in developing skills that will allow them to forecast and predict economic and business trends.", "learning_resources": "Weekly office hours, lecture slides, lecture notes, and articles/texts (made available on the course webpage).", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
