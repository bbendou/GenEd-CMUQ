Even as most organizations continue to change, one constant is the importance of effective communication. Upward, downward, and lateral communications are the lifeblood of organizations.

It will focus on problems that are likely to arise in the workplace and ways to solve them through communication. The students will build a portfolio of solutions that will demonstrate their evolving skills of applying rhetoric in organizational contexts. Specific topics will include the attributes of great communicators including leaders and managers as communicators, the challenges of communicating in organizations as we play particular roles e.g., individual contributor, manager or team member, ways to build credibility and enhance internal resumes, and techniques to master communication requirements related to performance management processes, conflict situations, and changing organizational culture and design. We will also explore a myriad of organizational issues such as communicating across generations and cultures, communicating externally, and communicating through technology.", "student_sets": [{"id": 895, "name": "graduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Communication", "slug": "communication", "id": 1188}], "attributes": [{"name": "communication", "id": 1, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": null, "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": null, "relevance": null, "learning_resources": null, "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
