If you take only one course in HumanComputer Interaction, this is the course for you. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from HumanComputer Interaction. Coursework includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group projects. This class is open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or nontechnical majors. However, there is a programming prerequisite.
