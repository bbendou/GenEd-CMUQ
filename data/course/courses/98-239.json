They will share their plan and progress and consult me about it. Students will be responsible for two big assignments (one midterm and one final). The midterm will involve writing an essay on any aspect of the game, and the final will be an essay reflecting on all of the concepts that they learned, how they improved throughout the semester, and what they will do moving forward. While this course is primarily focused on playing a video game, the concepts of learning from your mistakes and developing a plan to improve can be applied to real life, and I would also like to see students reflect on their own lives and help them set goals outside of the video game.", "relevance": "With millions of players and an active competitive scene, League of Legends has become one of the most prominent names in esports.
