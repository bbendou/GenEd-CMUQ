It seeks to understand the computational principles and mechanisms of intelligent behaviors and mental abilities  such as perception, language, motor control, and learning  by building artificial systems and computational models with the same capabilities. This course explores how neurons encode and process information, adapt and learn, communicate, cooperate, compete and compute at the individual level as well as at the levels of networks and systems. It will introduce basic concepts in computational modeling, information theory, signal processing, system analysis, statistical and probabilistic inference. Concrete examples will be drawn from the visual system and the motor systems,  and studied from computational, psychological and biological perspectives. Students will learn to perform computational experiments using Matlab and quantitative studies of neurons and neuronal networks.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Computer Sciences", "slug": "computer-sciences", "id": 325}, {"name": "Artificial Intelligence", "slug": "artificial-intelligence", "id": 338}, {"name": "Computer Modeling", "slug": "computer-modeling", "id": 850}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will learn to perform quantitative analysis as well as computational experiments using Matlab and deep learning platforms.", "key_topics": "This course explores computational issues at multiple levels, from individual neurons to circuits and systems, with a view to bridging brain science and machine learning.
