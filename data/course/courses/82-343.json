Students may begin with any one of the three courses at this level or they may be taken concurrently.  This course will explore Latin American culture and language, focusing on issues of cultural identity. Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are becomes a central debate Larrain 1996.  These periods include the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nationstates, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture Larrain 1996. The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from How does Latin America think of itself What does Latin America want to be. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact thisese identityies. The course will be taught in Spanish.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}, {"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be introduced to different literary genres and works of art from Latin America in order to understand its cultures and identify significant historical eventsStudents will hone their oral, aural, reading, and writing skills in Spanish not only through the diverse primary and secondary sources, but also through class activities that promote the Spanish languageStudents will be exposed to different dialects and vocabulary in Spanish, both through class readings and through the selection of music and films for the courseStudents will learn how to formulate and express arguments in Spanish related to Latin American culture, a set of skills that will be useful in future studies.", "key_topics": "\u00bf\tWhat is Latin America?\n\u00bf\tLatin American literature, film, art, food, and music\n\u00bf\tSpanish language\n\u00bf\tLiterary genres\n\u00bf\tpre-Columbian cultures\n\u00bf\tHistorical events", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Intermediate Spanish II, placement, or permission of the instructor", "assessment_structure": "20% \tParticipation\n5% \tNews Reports\n15%\tResponses on Canvas\n10%\tClass Presentations\n20%\tMidterm project\n30%\tFinal project", "relevance": "Latin America, broadly defined, constitutes over twenty countries in two continents just south of the United States.
