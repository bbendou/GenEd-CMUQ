We will cover topics such as Americas perennial battles between isolationism and internationalism, the creation of the USled world order after 1945, the containment of communism, and antiterrorism after 911. We will cover enduring and global issues like climate change, nuclear nonproliferation, humanitarian intervention, and international economic policy, as well. Further, a main focus of the course is how foreign policy is made  the role each branch of government plays in foreign policy making, the impact of domestic politics and public opinion, and how other countries receive and react to American foreign policy. The course will use both history and data analysis to understand how foreign policy works, how it is made, and its effect both at home and abroad. A good grasp of the 20th century American and world history, and some familiarity with international relations theory are not requirements but will prove helpful. By the end of the semester, students should have acquired a broad understanding of the most important foreign policy events of the last century and have the tools to analyze foreign policy decisionmaking.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the semester you will be an informed consumer of academic and policy debates about US foreign policy, capable of critically engaging with different arguments and positions, and articulating your own views, orally and in writing.
