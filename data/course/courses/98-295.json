We will study the design of pin tumbler padlocks and deadbolts, which comprise the majority of locks one will encounter. Students will learn how to use singlepinpicking techniques to pick such locks. We will also look at bypass techniques such as unshielded padlock entry, bump keys, and padlock shimming. With this knowledge, students will be able to assess the security of their belongings and, of course, will never get locked out of their homes again. There is a fee of 30 per student to cover the cost of basic tools and a practice lock.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Picking", "slug": "picking", "id": 1948}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will be better informed buyers of physical security items and will have developed a unique, useful skill.", "key_topics": "Pin tumbler, bypassing, decoding, wafter, tubular, and other locks studied.
