This course will equip students with the tools necessary to enter professional policyrelated domains.

It is also intended to make this class fun and engaging, creating a safe and welcoming environment for students to reflect on their own work, and their colleagues. During the course, students will write a policy memo, an oped, and a National Security Memo, as well as some smaller additional writing assignments as well as deliver multiple professionalstyle briefings for a variety of audiences.
