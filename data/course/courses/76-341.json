But how were race and gender, and their intersections, actually forged and navigated in the age of Austen This 300level course will look at Romanticera in both a historical and a contemporary context. Through reading, viewing, and graded assignments including short essays and oral presentations, we will practice methods for analyzing the formal features of literary and visual texts, such as the structure of a novel, the rhythms of poetry, or the costuming of period drama. In doing so, we will ask how do these texts respond to historical phenomena such as empire, the rights of women, and slavery and abolition How and why do contemporary adaptations take up these questions Examples of readings include Aphra Behns Ooronoko, Jonathan Swifts The Ladys Dressing Room, Jane Austens Mansfield Park, Mary Princes The History of Mary Prince, and William Wordsworths To Toussaint LOuverture.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Performance", "slug": "performance", "id": 1641}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Better understanding of Regency and long 18thc literature improved writing and presentation skills better knowledge of literary criticism methods", "key_topics": "Adaptation, regency, Romantic era, empire, race, slavery, gender, visual culture, material culture", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Basic knowledge of literary analysis", "assessment_structure": "Oral presentations, short written assignments, participation", "relevance": "Students will gain a greater understanding of how present conversations about race and gender are shaped by the literature and culture of the long eighteenth century; develop skills in critical thinking and literary analysis; and learn strategies for written and oral expression.", "learning_resources": "2 novels to purchase; other readings available on Canvas and Perusall", "extra_time_commitment": null}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
