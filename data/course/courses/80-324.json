This issue will allow us to analyze a wide number of foundational issues in economics including the testability of economic claims, the use of rationality postulates, the foundation of the right to property, and measuring the success or failure of an economy.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Political Sciences", "slug": "political-sciences", "id": 1260}, {"name": "Philosophy", "slug": "philosophy", "id": 1263}], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of this course, I want you to understand the underlying assumptions used by economists when making economic models.
