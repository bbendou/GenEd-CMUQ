Students will be divided into teams and will work together as potential cofounders throughout the course, giving them a realistic experience of the startup journey. Through engaging lectures, practical exercises, and realworld case studies, we will explore key concepts such as product market fit, marketing strategies, financing a business, and wireframing. Each week, we will delve deeper into one of these topics and students will have the opportunity to apply their understanding to their own startup idea, through regular feedback and mentorship from instructors and guest industry experts. The course will culminate in a final pitch where students will present their startup to the class and instructors, giving them a taste of the realworld experience in incubator and accelerator applications. Grading will be based on the quality of the pitch, the progress made on the startup throughout the course, and participation in class discussions and group work.
