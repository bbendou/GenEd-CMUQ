While millions of new users are signing up for decentralized platforms and billions of dollars are being invested, the importance of knowing the proper tools and techniques for guarding against possible attacks that compromise users security or privacy is crucial. Since in the case of decentralized applications there is no central authority in charge, the digital assets that are stolen can hardly be recovered. That is why people who are new to the crypto space often make irreversible mistakes that cost them a lot of money. Luckily, this course provides foundational knowledge for minimizing the risk of compromising privacy and security while interacting with applications built on blockchains. Students will be taught how to create crypto wallets, write smart contracts, deploy new cryptocurrencies, mint new NFTs, and more.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": true, "is_req_repeatable": true, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [], "custom_fields": {"goals": "By the end of the course, students should have a good understanding of the key concept involved in the Security and Privacy of Blockchain Technologies such as the history and fundamentals of Blockchain Technologies, the importance of high security of decentralized systems built on blockchain, the importance of privacy in the Web3 ecosystem and the ways of achieving and maintaining them in the long term.

When successful, such attacks can have devastating consequences for individuals, companies, and society in general. We have seen multiple instances of successful attacks on decentralized applications built on Blockchain, some of which have wiped out billions of dollars of cryptocurrencies in just a matter of hours. It has happened to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and more recently Terra and is almost guaranteed to happen again to the old or new blockchains. As more and more money flows into the crypto ecosystem, the incentive for bad guys to attack the system goes us, hence the importance of having the fundamental knowledge of how to protect yourself from such attacks becomes more profound.
