In addition to project work done in class, students will learn fundamental tools like Unreal, Autodesk Maya, Substance Painter, and Photoshop. Additionally, they will learn to use source control and work as a team. Students will complete a game project under guidance, and gain insight into the steps involved in creating a game. There will be weekly lectures, intermittent optional and guest lectures. Well use a Discord server as our primary means of communication.
