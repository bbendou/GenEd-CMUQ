By engaging in technology as a lens, this sequence of weekend microcourses encourages students to examine technology as a system disproportionately impacting humanity by enabling and constraining human rights of groups of people around the globe. With a multidisciplinary focus, the course invites researchers and practitioners from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and relevant fields more broadly. In Spring 2024, the focus will be on the impact technology has on criminal justice. This will include a discussion about technologys impact on human safety, including the increasing use of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and other technology by various authorities of the criminal justice system. This will include discussions on the benefits and risks in the implementation and automation of such technology within criminal justice apparatuses. We will also consider how such implementation differs across global criminal justice systems, including how this technology is governed. Added Note The course will occur on Friday, Mar. 22, Saturday, Mar. 23, and Sunday, Mar. 24. Engagement in the course should be synchronous accommodations for those in significant time zone differences will be provided to allow enrollment and completion of all elements of the weekend.
