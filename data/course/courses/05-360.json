The course is for both students who may only enroll in one interaction design course and those who intend to build upon their HCI learning by taking advanced interaction design courses. Students must work effectively as individuals and in small teams to learn interaction design concepts and apply them to realworld problems.  By the end of this course students should be able to  Apply appropriate interaction design methods in a humancentered design process. Create persuasive interim and final design artifacts that demonstrate communication design fundamentals. Facilitate productive and structured critique across the class and with instructors. Explain and apply fundamental interaction design principles. Create clarity and readability in artifacts, including GUIs and deliverables, through the disciplined application of visual design principles such as typography, color and composition. Practice reframing a given problem in order to create opportunities that drive generating multiple solutions. Demonstrate habits that foster the creative process, including drawing, divergent thinking, and creative experimentation. Identify and explore with interaction design materials.  This course serves as a prerequisite for Advanced Interaction Design Studio number TBD.   Students who are required to take this course have priority and will be enrolled first.
