The class provides an overview of the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of prejudice and discrimination as it pertains to many forms of inequality. Its goal is to examine social differences and social inequality in many areas of society. The psychological theories underlying these behaviors will be examined as well as their impact on the lives of stigmatized individuals. In addition to the traditional forms of prejudice based on such things as race, gender and age, other inequalities that result from less traditional groupings such as social class, appearance, and disability will be explored. Research on issues of social identity, intergroup relations and the reduction of prejudice will be examined through readings and class activities.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Social Psychology", "slug": "social-psychology", "id": 1193}, {"name": "Cognitive Psychology", "slug": "cognitive-psychology", "id": 1194}, {"name": "Ageing", "slug": "ageing", "id": 1602}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Demonstrate an awareness of the biases individuals have that affect reasoning and decision making regarding others.Explain prejudice as a product of a range of factors since the development of prejudice is a function of individual differences, situational factors, and societal factors.
