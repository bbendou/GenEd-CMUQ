And all these questions can be put under the following single umbrella  What is computation and how does it shape our understanding of life, science, technology, and society  This course is for anyone interested in these questions and more broadly, anyone interested in the algorithmic lens to tackle hard, foundational problems. Our goal will be to find reliable explanations through modeling and rigorous reasoning. We will discuss great and powerful ideas from the field of theory of computation and see how these ideas shed new light on human reasoning, laws of nature, life, technology, and society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": "computationallens.com", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Define the notions of computation, algorithm, and computational complexity.Express and compare the computability and computational complexity of problems.State and give examples of the connections of the theory of computation with mathematics, physics, biology, statistics, philosophy, social sciences and economics.State and give examples of technological realworld applications of the theory of computation.Recognize the use of ideas and techniques from the theory of computation, like modeling, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, reductions, classifications.State and explain the important and wellknown open problems in the theory of computation and their connections to other fields.", "key_topics": "Introduction to mathematical reasoning\nFormalization of computation\nUncountability\nUncomputability\nUnprovability\nComputational complexity\nGraph/network theory\nP vs NP\nOverview of randomness in computer science\nRandomized algorithms\nCryptography\nQuantum computation\nStatistical physics\nLearning theory\nEvolution as a learning algorithm\nFair division\nAlgorithmic game theory\nInteractive Proofs", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Some elementary programming experience.
