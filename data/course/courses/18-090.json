Signals are the raw materials used in many forms of electronic art and design  electronic music, interactive art, video art, kinetic sculpture, and more. In these fields, signals are used to represent information about sound, images, sensors, and movement. By transforming and manipulating these types of signals, we are able to create powerful new tools for digital art, multimedia applications, music, responsive environments, video and sound installation, smart products, and beyond.  In this course we will study Signal Processing from a practical pointofview, developing tools that can be easily integrated into artmaking using the graphical programming environment Max a.k.a. MaxMSPJitter.  We will present a survey of Signal Processing techniques used in the sonic and visual arts, and will discuss the mathematical theories underlying these techniques.  Students will be encouraged to combine, modify, and extend working examples of software to create original digital artworks.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Visual Arts", "slug": "visual-arts", "id": 1347}, {"name": "Digital Arts", "slug": "digital-arts", "id": 1351}, {"name": "Digital Visual Arts", "slug": "digital-visual-arts", "id": 1355}, {"name": "Video", "slug": "video", "id": 1431}, {"name": "Sculpture", "slug": "sculpture", "id": 1463}, {"name": "Art Design", "slug": "art-design", "id": 1537}, {"name": "Manipulation", "slug": "manipulation", "id": 1718}], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ideate", "id": 8, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Present a survey of Signal Processing techniques that are used in the sonic and visual arts.
