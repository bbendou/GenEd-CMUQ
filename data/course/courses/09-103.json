Students will develop fundamental chemical knowledge in topics such as stoichiometry, atomic theory, molecular bonding and structure, chemical reactions, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry. This knowledge will be applied to a variety of topics, including biological, industrial, environmental, agricultural, and culinary applications, helping students to understand how chemistry affects environmental, social, political, and economic issues. Through this course, students will develop both qualitative understanding and quantitative skills in chemistry.
