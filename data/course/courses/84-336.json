Rather, successful policy is the result of thorough research, careful drafting, and successful navigation within the government or nongovernment organization whose leadership may ultimately promulgate it.  The course begins with a brief review of government and organizational behavior in a bureaucracy, and the identification of a federal agencys policy system as a framework to which we will turn throughout the term.  Study then shifts to an overview of several legal concepts and research skills applicable to federal policy and regulations.  Though usually the province of law students and attorneys, such skills enable Students to know when policy may be crafted from scratch  or where, when, and how policy must conform to larger governing legal or regulatory structure.  Students then consider a particular public policy subcomponent, administrative law, which addresses the special circumstance of regulatory agencies and the statutory regimes that create and govern the federal policies created thereunder.  The course culminates with Students developing and staffing a notional policy, modeled on the federal agency policy system model studied throughout the term.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Public Administration", "slug": "public-administration", "id": 1267}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Understand and analyze an organizational structure in which policy is made and implemented.Understand and demonstrate the ability to think and write like a successful member of the organization in which policy is made.Understand and apply basic legal research skills critical to successful public policy development at the federal level.Distinguish policies that are discretionary in nature from those required by legal mandateComprehend the special case of federal public policies promulgated by regulatory agencies, which are part of the general category of administrative law.Recognize the importance of, and apply, precise language in policy drafting.Develop, notionally staff, and present a draft policy responsive to a current public policy issue.", "key_topics": "Political Science; U.S. Government; Law and Legal Research; Organizational Behavior; Policy", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Excellent writing and critical thinking skills.
