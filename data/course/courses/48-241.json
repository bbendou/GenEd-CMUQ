We ask critical questions about the canon, the changing nature of history and theory, the biases embedded in terms like modernism, progress, and NonWestern, and the deep legacies of colonialism, globalization, extractivism, and capitalism in which modern architecture so actively participated. The course loosely works backward in time to explore major movements and monuments of the EuroAmerican avantgarde and socalled heroes of modernism, but also diverse responses to modernity, including popular, tropical, vernacular, indigenous, and even antiarchitecture around the world, including increasingly the Global South. The course content changes slightly every year to acknowledge the evolving understanding of the subject, but also to keep up with changes in architectural education, the discipline of architectural history, and professional practice, as well as changes in global culture, social context, and our student aspirations.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": "soa.cmu.edu", "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Modern History", "slug": "modern-history", "id": 1266}, {"name": "Architecture", "slug": "architecture", "id": 1349}, {"name": "Picking", "slug": "picking", "id": 1948}], "attributes": [{"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will understand the most important movements, ideas, design principles, texts and buildings of the 20thC, the core or canon of what we call modern architecture.", "key_topics": "Trends in modern architecture, including: Formal tendencies; Theoretical issues; National traditions; Biographical sketches; Technologies and materials; Political motivations; Social & cultural influences", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Reading, writing, interest in architecture", "assessment_structure": "Written reading reports, exams, attendance", "relevance": "To differentiate \"modern\" architecture from that of previous eras and the present. - To begin to understand the importance of \"theory\" and its influence on architecture - To uncover the diversity of ideas and design occurring at any given time and within each movement, and how they inter-relate and influence each other.", "learning_resources": "Course textbooks, Canvas site with readings", "extra_time_commitment": "The course includes 2-3 Thu. evening sections over the semester to make room for smaller discussions"}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
