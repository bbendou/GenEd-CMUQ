This course is designed for students that want to learn about AI and machine learning but dont have the course schedule bandwidth to build up the math and computing background required for fullfledged intro AI and ML courses, such as 15281 and 10301. Leveraging high school algebra and basic Python programming skills from 15110, well help you implement key pieces of AI techniques from the nearest neighbor algorithm to simple neural networks. Through inclass activities, weekly recitations, and course assignments, youll start to learn how to use AI systems, including how to make them intelligent, what data might be needed, and what can go wrong. Ethical discussions will be woven throughout the course to enable you to think critically about how AI impacts our society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": null, "key_topics": "Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Ethics", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Basic programming skills in Python as learned in 15-110 (15-112 is certainly sufficient).
