The material in this course and in 36236 Probability and Statistical Inference II is organized so as to provide repeated exposure to essential concepts the courses cover specific probability distributions and their inferential applications one after another, starting with the normal distribution and continuing with the binomial and Poisson distributions, etc. Topics specifically covered in 36235 include basic probability, random variables, univariate and multivariate distribution functions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression, with the discussion being supplemented with computerbased examples and exercises e.g., visualization and simulation. Given its organization, the course is only appropriate for those taking the full twosemester sequence, and thus it is currently open only to statistics majors primary, additional, dual and minors. Check with the statistics advisors for the exact declaration deadline. Nonmajorsminors requiring a probability course are directed to take 36225 or one of its analogues. A grade of C or better in 36235 is required in order to advance to 36236 or 36226 andor 36410.
