The course will have a strong component of Special Relativity, dealing with kinematics and dynamics, but not electricity and magnetism. See 33213 description. It will introduce students to a conceptual theory, which is mathematically simple but initially nonintuitive. The course also provides a broad exposure to quantum phenomena and early quantum theory without getting overly mathematical.

Summarize in what way the relativistic notion of spacetime differs from the Galilean notion of space and time, and give examples of phenomena where these two notions are starkly in conflict. Know when and how to perform Lorentz transformations between different frames of reference. Describe and use applications of relativistic kinematics, such as how velocities add, the relativistic Doppler effect, and the collimating of light beams emitted by moving observers. Understand how the notions of energy and momentum conservation translate into a relativistic framework, and then apply them to solve various problems of particles colliding, decaying, or being created. Regale anyone who would listen, at length, about why, indeed, E mc. Explain how Planck out of sheer desperation invented the idea of photons, which solved the longstanding problem of black body radiation. And how Einstein ran with that idea and explained the photoelectric effect. Name several experimental facts which support the idea that energy levels in atoms are quantized. Argue why Rutherfords scattering experiment supported the idea of an atom as a tiny heavy nucleus surrounded by orbiting electrons, and then show how Bohr combined this with the radical idea of angular momentum quantization to arrive at the first quantitative prediction of an atomic spectrumthat of hydrogen. Tell the story how Moseley quantitatively explained key patterns in the Xray spectra of elements, and this way finally put the periodic table of chemistry on a clear physical foundation.
