This course takes a cue from Smith by examining the social production of disasters in the past and present, from acute environmental events like typhoons and earthquakes to disasters of slow violence like chronic exposure to toxic pollution and food insecurity.  Examining case studies from around the world, we will explore how these different forms of disaster collide with inequalities of race, class, and gender  and in the process challenge us to rethink the relationship between nature and society.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "research", "id": 14, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "sustainability/environment", "id": 16, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Students will advance their knowledge of how social processes both interact with environmental hazards while strengthening their critical reading, writing, and research skills.", "key_topics": "This course will examine the social production of disasters in the past and present, using case studies from around the world to illuminate how different forms of disaster collide with inequalities of race, class, and gender.", "prerequisite_knowledge": null, "assessment_structure": "Students will write brief reflection papers, participate in dicussion leadership, and conduct research into a relevant topic of their choosing.", "relevance": "Students will learn to analyze disasters from an anthropological and political-ecological perspective, while developing analytical skills that they can apply in a wide range of professional fields.", "learning_resources": "Students will read a variety of scholarly texts, news reports, and commentaries.
