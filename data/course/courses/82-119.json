Participants will apply proper techniques to producing calligraphy in two of the most commonly used styles, Naskh and Riqah, as well as experiment with some modern script styles.

The course introduces the writing system in an artistic context that allows for the discovery of cultural connections. Senior students may not have had the opportunity to learn much about Arabic or Arab culture but will find the focus on artistic expressions of Arabic a welcome ending to their time at Carnegie Mellon. The course will help those enrolled, including our cultural heritage students, see the Arabic alphabet and Arabic culture from a different perspective. This course is an opportunity to see Arabic in a broader context and from a rarely explored perspective: Visual Expression.", "learning_resources": "Students use chapters of textbooks, a collection of articles, videos, VR site visits, and manuscript collections in print and online.", "extra_time_commitment": "Outside of a few class readings, videos, completing \"did I get it\" practices, and discussions, a minimum of 1 hour and a maximum of four hours of calligraphy practice outside are expected.
