Moreover, with code mobility now commonplaceparticularly in the context of web technologies and digital rights managementsystem designers are increasingly faced with protecting hosts from foreign software and protecting software from foreign hosts running it. This class takes a close look at software as a mechanism for attack, as a tool for protecting resources, and as a resource to be defended. Topics covered include the software design process choices of programming languages, operating systems, databases and distributed object platforms for building secure systems common software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and race conditions auditing software proving properties of software software and data watermarking code obfuscation tamper resistant software and the benefits of open and closed source development.
