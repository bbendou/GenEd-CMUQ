CMU students will engage in task analysis to break down all the steps their partner students will have to follow to create the final productproject.  Students in this course will also explore the highlights of teaching methodology to prepare them with the necessary tools to reach their middle school audience.  As a culmination of the course, college students will implement these projects in Arts Greenhouse partner schools.  Additionally, CMU students will put into practice the leadership skills necessary to build working relationships with community partners.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "service learning", "id": 15, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "Analyze student audienceCreate a humanitiesbased, handson project relevant to the audienceEngage in task analysis to break down a multistep project into incremental stepsDemonstrate use of effective teaching methodologyImplement this project with students in a local middle schoolInteract with community partners to establish a plan for implementing the projectEvaluate the successes and weaknesses of the project implementationUtilize reflection to write recommendations for changes in future project implementation", "key_topics": "-\nProject design and implementation\n-\nCreative learning\n-\nPedagogical considerations\n-\nCommunity-responsive programming\n-\nCommunity Outreach\n-\nProgram observation", "prerequisite_knowledge": "Students should meet the prerequisites for the course.
