At the same time well learn about how, in response, other people work extremely hard to defend books against removal and censorship.  The term banned books, can be a bit misleading in the US context only in very rare cases does the US federal government get involved in trying to ban or censor a published work. Nonetheless, the US is a hot spot for those who seek to attack books, and for those who seek to defend them. In this course you will find that the actions of attackers and the actions of defenders are often mutually reinforcing.  Every student in this course will contribute to a public facing website called The CMU Banned Books project. This website is used by journalists, scholars and activists around the world. This semesters books for reading and discussion include some of the most frequently banned and challenged books of the last five years, including The Handmaids Tale, Gender Queer, The 1619 Project, and The Absolutely True Diary of a PartTime Indian. Since 2020, organizations that track book banning tell us that the numbers of books banned andor challenged are at an alltime high.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 1}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "ethics", "id": 5, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "team project", "id": 17, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "recognize how specific works of literature are connected to history and culture\nunderstand what is free speech and how it is connected to literature\ndevelop an appreciation for a diverse range of literature of their aesthetic qualities and insights into human experiences\napply analytical and expressive skills through close reading and research", "key_topics": "free speech, First amendment, censorship, literature and politics, diversity, identity, African American literature", "prerequisite_knowledge": "general knowledge of American history", "assessment_structure": "reading journals, research project including a presentation and paper, class discussion", "relevance": "encourage critical thinking and exposure to diverse experience and ideas", "learning_resources": "supplementary readings, recorded lectures, videos, web pages", "extra_time_commitment": "Students will be expected to read the novels, do research for the final project, and complete reading journals"}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
