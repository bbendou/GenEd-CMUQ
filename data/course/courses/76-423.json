To explore these contestations, we will look at a series of controversies. This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality. Beginning with several works about regionalIslamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion. With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements. Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage. For each of these controversies, we will be reading a range of positions represented in different types of writing across genre, including scholarly writing, legal cases, media debates, films and literature.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "intermittent", "type": "INFO"}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [{"name": "Veil", "slug": "veil", "id": 1012}], "attributes": [{"name": "discussion intensive", "id": 2, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "diversity", "id": 3, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "for non-majors", "id": 6, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "interdisciplinary", "id": 10, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "reading intensive", "id": 13, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "writing intensive", "id": 18, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "intercultural & global lrng", "id": 22, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "equity & inclusion", "id": 23, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "students will complicate ideas of Western feminism through a global, transnational and historical approach", "key_topics": "feminism, global studies, gender", "prerequisite_knowledge": "This course builds on previous knowledge of gender studies and feminism", "assessment_structure": "regular discussion posts, long seminar paper, oral presentation", "relevance": "this course is targeted to students interested in further discussions of feminism in a global context", "learning_resources": "online texts and texts for purchase", "extra_time_commitment": "individual meetings"}, "admin_context": {"suggested_by_advisor": null, "counts_for": []}, "success": true}
