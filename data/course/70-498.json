Accounting numbers Accounting numbers such as those in published corporate financialstatements obey a basic doubleentry bookkeeping structure leading to a matrix or graphrepresentation beyond the typical numerical data structure. After a basic introduction of usingcorporate financial data, much of the course covers the concepts and tools that processcorporate accounting data using the graph representation. Accounting texts While texts in accounting documents are written in natural language, theymust obey regulatory disclosure requirements in both substance and form. The remaining partof the course shows students how data in text form from accounting disclosures such as annualreports can be examined systematically using textual analysis techniques to gain further insightand knowledge about firms and industries beyond those inferred from nontextual data.  This course may use thirdparty copyright material. If so, the thirdparty course material will be secured and provided by the Tepper School to students enrolled in the course, and students enrolled in the course will be required to pay to the University the associated additional course materials fee for the thirdparty course material provided.   The amount of the course materials fee is dependent on the Universitys cost of the particular materials provided, and typically ranges from 13 to 75.", "student_sets": [{"id": 896, "name": "undergraduate"}], "offering_tags": [{"name": "specific_sem", "type": "INFO", "sem": 2}], "website": null, "instructors": [], "is_repeatable": false, "is_req_repeatable": false, "repeat_limit_attempts": null, "repeat_limit_credits": null, "catalog_levels": [], "skills": [], "attributes": [{"name": "communication & presentation", "id": 19, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "information & data literacy", "id": 20, "type": "attribute"}, {"name": "collaboration & teamwork", "id": 21, "type": "attribute"}], "custom_fields": {"goals": "The central focus of course is on the structure of business language in both numbers and texts, notnecessarily on analytical tools and techniques which would likely change over time.
