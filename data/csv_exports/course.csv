He mixes braggadocio, lies, flattery, empty promises, and a victimhood narrative to depict himself as the countrys savior and to attract millions to his personality cult. If elected, he vows to make future elections unnecessary, rule as a dictator, stop outsiders from poisoning the nations blood, and rid the country of leftist vermin. He fearmongers about who deserves membership in the nation, the countrys international obligations, crime, the economy, and a faraway war to divide the people. The last person standing between him and his goal is an octogenarian president running for reelection.

This course will train you in the historians skillset and mindset so you can act democratically. You will learn to tell facts from opinions and to see from various angles. The course will push you to think for yourself and to argue effectively for your own position.

This impulse resulted in ten amendments to the Constitution, which we have come to know as the Bill of Rights.   The very first and arguably considered at the time as the most essential of these was the First Amendment, which we sometimes call the free speech amendment to the Constitution.

80-254,The History of Analytic Philosophy and Its Influence,9,9,9,True,False,ANALYTIC PHILOSOPHY,"This course is about the influence of Analytic Philosophy on contemporary thought. Analytic philosophy is a tradition within Western Philosophy that aims for clear writing, rigor in arguments, and continuity with both the formal and the empirical sciences. The goal is to study early Analytic Philosophy and Logical Positivism to lay a foundation for understanding more recent work in their tradition.  Early figures of Analytic Philosophy include Gottlob Frege 1848, who provided a theory of meaning, developed modern logic and aimed to reduce arithmetic to logic Bertrand Russell 1872, who adopted Freges logic as a method to expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems and George Edward Moore 1873, who argued that goodness cannot be analyzed by the methods of natural science and defended common sense beliefs against both skepticism and British idealism. The early figures and Russells student Ludwig Wittgenstein 1889 emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which should be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language. The quest for an ideal language inspired Logical Positivismthe thesis that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful.   This course invites you to delve into the development of Analytic Philosophy to date. We will read groundbreaking papers by the mentioned philosophers and more recent ones. This year, we will focus in particular on the subjective interpretation of probability as degrees of belief offered by Frank Plumpton Ramsey 1903 and the development of theories of causality from Hans Reichenbach 1891 over John Leslie Mackie 1917 and David Kellogg Lewis 1941 to the contemporary work conducted at Carnegie Mellon University.",80,

Under certain conditions, such systems can produce useful systemlevel behaviors, display selforganized spatialtemporal patterns, effectively perform computations, information dissemination, and decisionmaking. Loosely speaking, when this happens we can say that the system is displaying a form of collective intelligence.  Collective intelligence will expose students to relevant mathematical and computational models from following fields and domains Cellular automata and Random boolean networks, Social choice, Game theory, Distributed consensus, Task allocation, Swarm intelligence, Social networks, Pattern formation, and Selforganizing maps.

The proofs of these results require a novel metamathematical perspective, but also striking logical concepts and fascinating mathematical techniques. In this course, the theorems are not just formulated but actually proved. We begin with the axiomatic development of elementary set theory that allows, at the same time, the formal representation of informal mathematics like number theory.  With this basis, one can show that syntactic notions concerning set theory are representable in the very theory.  It is then easy to prove that set theory is incomplete.  To show that logic is undecidable, the crucial concept of computation is introduced via Turing machines.   The two central concepts  proof and computation  are fundamental for mathematics, computer science and, in particular, artificial intelligence.   The undecidability and incompleteness results are among the most significant contributions of modern logic to the foundations of mathematics. They provide also the beginnings of a deeper understanding of mental processes in cognitive science and, thus, of the human mind.  To understand the latter connections, we will read about and discuss historical as well as philosophical aspects of the subject.",80,(15-251 [] at least C) or (21-300 [] at least C) or (80-310 [] at least C) or (80-211 [] at least C) or (80-210 [] at least B)

This course will take six case studies concerning cultural practices that have generated global debates about the status of women and issues like consent, freedom, and equality.  Beginning with several works about regionalIslamic practices of veiling, we will look specifically at the close connections made between womens practices and elements of tradition, including religion.  With an eye toward historicizing feminist interventions, we will look at 19th century debates on sati, commonly called widow burning, in India, to see how certain issues became loci for global intervention during colonial periods and, later, for global feminist movements.  Within the contemporary period, we will turn to cultural, economic and political practices like female genital cutting, transnational domestic labor, global sex trade, and transnational forced marriage.

Why is causality essential How can we learn it, including latent variables, from observational data What role does causality play in learning under data heterogeneity Can causal principles make generative AI more controllable and capable of extrapolation How can deep learning benefit from a causal perspective Two main causality problems are emphasized. One is causal discovery or causal representation learning. It is well known that correlation does not imply causality, but we will make it more precise by asking what assumptions, what information in the data, and what procedures enable us to successfully recover causal information. Causal relations may happen among the underlying hidden variableswe will also see how to uncover the underlying hidden causal variables as well as their causal relations from the measured variables. The other is how to properly make use of causal information. This includes identification of causal effects, counterfactual reasoning, and improving machine learning with causal knowledge.",80,

When used effectively, these legal tools can lead to significant and sometimes surprising business advantages. Patent rights can enable small companies to prevent copying by competitors, earn higher revenue from licensing technology, and compete more effectively against much larger firms. Knowledge of technology rights can provide a powerful competitive advantage and provide many nonintuitive  opportunities. In addition, these legal mechanisms can be made even more effective if they are integrated with the organizations innovation processes the way that organizations manage the conception, development, and production of new products, services, technologies, and business models.

As we think, read, and converse together, we will endeavor to come to terms with the problems and paradoxes of racial representation in the early modern theater, a forum that offered access to innovative, daring thinking about human equality and ethical responsibility, but was also a site for the perpetuation of hateful stereotypes and exploitative theories of white supremacy.

The movements founder, C.S. Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was developed and popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also wellknown for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving. The pragmatists made lasting contributions to modern statistics, logic, and social science and their emphases on community, fallibility, action, and value in science are still of primary importance in philosophy and in the ongoing dialogue between the scientific and humanistic cultures.",80,

76-267,The Short Story,9,9,9,True,True,GENRE STUDIES,"Poe defined the short story as something that could be read at one sitting. While simple enough, the definition in fact suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. In a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century, and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to, it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So, with the short story, we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling, or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attentionand feelingin order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. Well make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers Hemingway and Borges in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.  Students can expect to develop their historical understanding of current experience and to gain an understanding of how to interpret and comment on significant pieces of fiction.

With more than half of the worlds population connected to the Internet, we are more connected than ever. But, despite how seamless the Internet may have made communication, the fact that language is rooted in culture complicates CMC, even if the language is English.   The omnipresence of English leads people to assume that a common language implies a shared understanding of a given topic. But, speaking the same language does not mean we share the same cultural values, or that we even understand or are aware of other cultural values and beliefs. English may be the lingua franca in many organizations and professional settings, but the commingling of globalization and CMC raises some questions including How can professional communicators contribute to shaping a workplace discourse that transcends national or regional borders to reach a global audience   This course will address these questions by explaining the specific ways in which our backgrounds from personal to social and even national influence professional and technical communication the impact of globalization on the workplace, especially in times of crisis and the ways in which we can rely on general concepts and principles in order to communicate effectively in specific international settings and situations.",76,(76-270 [] at least D) or (76-272 [] at least D) or (76-271 [] at least D)

82-294,19th Century Russian Masterpieces,9,9,12,True,False,19TH CENT RSSN MSTRP,"Russian literature of the 19th century was shaped by its engagement with the socalled accursed questionsaccursed for being urgent and inescapable but possibly unanswerable. What is the self What is the meaning of life and of death What is truth What is justice What does it mean to live a righteous life In Russia these existential quandaries fell within the purview not only of philosophers but also of the poets and prosewriters we will consider in this course. While the course roughly follows the chronology of the 19th century, it is structured around these accursed questions rather than by literary movement or genre. There are two reasons for this. First, Russias literary culture began to develop later than other traditions as a result, Russian authors of the 19th century were exposed to many different movements and often participated in several at once. Second, and relatedly, many authors worked across genres and in dialogue with philosophers, critics, novelists, and poets. They published in thick journals, composed of texts ranging from the literary to the journalistic to the academic. For these reasons, it is difficult to categorize these authors along stylistic or generic lines. As philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev observes, what united them was an abiding interest in the most profound existential questions. Students in this course will examine how an authors use of genre, affiliation with particular literary movements, and sociopolitical commitments inflected their treatment of the accursed questions. Students will become familiar with not only the cultural artifacts of this fertile century but also the circumstanceshistorical, cultural, institutionalin which these artifacts were created.

To get at the why behind the surprising things readers do with a text, we will draw on the psychology of reading, where socially constructed memory networks, cognitive schemas, and metaknowledge actively shape interpretation. To uncover readers interpretations, we put our knowledge to work trying out usertesting methods that help writers build effective audiencebased presentations, applications, websites, or guides.  We then take the same approach to writers as thinkers, examining the key problemsolving processes, from task representation, to planning, to revision, on which expert and novice writers often differ.  Learning to track problemsolving through process tracing methods, will let you carry out two case studies of your own.  The first will uncover the sometimes radical differences in how a small set of readers actually interpret a text you find significant. The second will be a case study of your own thinking process on a real task you are doing outside this class.

The standard history also insists that realism, while dominant in the 19th century, becomes a residual form in the 20th, replaced first by modernism, then postmodernism.  In globalpostcolonial fiction, ludic form, especially magical realism, becomes an important standard bearer of progressive politics in the mid20th century, again perceiving realism as residual.   This course interrogates that history by looking again at classic realist texts from France and England, reading them in conjunction with novels from the U.S., India, the Caribbean, and Africa, by charting uneven development of forms and richer modes of reading.

Part of the first wave of quality television series by which HBO changed the way people conceived of the artistic possibilities of the medium, the Wire differed from its contemporaries like The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in its realism and its smaller audience. Unlike most other shows on television, The Wire addressed the racism, poverty, the failures of the criminal justice system, and other social problems head on. It was able to do this in part because it had enough time to develop complex story threads. This moment of TV history produced what I am calling longform TV, in which narrative continuity was stretched over multiple seasons. TV in this form resembles 19th century novels that were first released serially in magazines and newspapers.  In both cases, audiences waited expectantly for new episodes, since they could not be bingewatched. The Wire was rooted in producerwriters David Simon and Ed Burns experiences in Baltimore, where the former had been a crime reporter and the latter a police detective. Simon has said that he made the series in order to tell truths about the city he could not tell in the newspapers.    This course will consider the wire in the context of realist fiction of the 19th century, twentiethcentury crime fiction, earlier TV crime series, and other longform TV, including Mad Men.

The discipline of linguistics has developed novel tools for describing and analyzing language over the last two hundred years and in this course we learn what these tools are and practice applying them. Subareas of linguistics which we study include phonetics the study of speech sounds, phonology the study of sound systems, morphology the study of parts of words, and syntax the study of combinations of words. Furthermore, we highlight various respects in which language and linguistics intersects with societal issues.  The methods of linguistics are useful in the study of particular languages and in the study of language generally, so this course is useful for students of foreign languages as well as those interested in going on to study language acquisition, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, philosophy of language, and computer modeling of language.",80,

This course examines nationmaking in China from the outside in. We privilege avenues of inquiry that challenge statesponsored narratives, complicate the hegemonic notion of Han as a majority identity, and consider ways in which processes of state consolidation and majoritization have subjected various ethnic, subethnic, diasporic, linguistic, gender, and religious communities to discrimination, marginalization, exclusion, and in some cases state and majoritarian violence. Rather than uncritically accepting the notion that China is a uniquely historical nation, we instead consider the possibility that the Chinese state and nation are products of the same transglobal currentssuch as imperialism, settler colonialism, assimilation, minoritization, and exclusion that has made our modern world. Whenever possible, we employ historical texts, short stories, novels, memoirs, and film produced by members of disadvantaged, marginalized, andor targeted communities in order to demonstrate how and why historical experiences and memories for example among ethnic minorities differ from the Han majority and from state orthodoxy, and why these differing perspectives matter.

For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion.

We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques  highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question What enables propaganda to circulate Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

The course emphasizes critical reading and research strategies for a variety of sources which become the basis for individually and collaborativelyproduced texts. The course introduces students to rhetorical choices within and across languages at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels. Students will explore a variety of practices in academic writing e.g., paraphrase, synthesis, counterargument and refutation, citation as they relate to genre, audience, purpose, and other factors of a communicative situation. We discuss and practice explicit rhetorical and linguistic conventions for writing in academic English so that writers make choices to connect with readers in academic and professional discourse communities. Students who take this course identify as multilingual students who use English skillfully but perhaps with less comfort as they use another language.

As a result, materials have been influential in the trade and commerce between societies and are still to this day, strongly involved in the political, economic and social conflicts worldwide.    Materials do not stand alone in development however, they are a result of, or are influenced by, technological needs and developments. The more advanced the material, the more energy and effort is required for its production. In the US, the production of materials accounts for about 90 of the countrys energy usage. This fact clearly indicates a strong tie between materials and energy, and without energy, technological developments based on material advancement will not occur.    In our world today, the need to provide improved performance, economics and design in consumer goods comes as a direct result of the market conditions established by consumers. Material selection and design therefore is driven by application and consumer needs which implies that the consumer has a large influence on material consumption. Material selection and material usage in turn have major ecological  implications in energy, material resources and direct environmental impact.

This class investigates how Congress overcomes the obstacles to action it faces as well as whether the institution has operated less effectively in recent years, and if so, the reasons why. Specifically, we will scrutinize what the legislative process looks like in practice and how the structure of Congress interacts with the electoral, partisan, ideological, and interestgroup influences on its members to determine their behavior. To accomplish this objective, we will apply rational choice theory to analyze Congress as social scientists do while also evaluating the limitations of this approach. In addition, we will examine the place Congress occupies in the broader governmental system, exploring its relationships with the presidency, courts, and federal bureaucracy.

Why and how do visual styles change over time e.g., Magazines from the 1950s dont look like present day magazines. Do visual elements have persuasive power If so, what roles do they play in shaping an argument How do people learn to communicate using visualverbal artifacts In this seminar, we will address these and other questions through readings and discussions on various threads of studies around the analysis of communicative artifacts that integrate visual and verbal expressions. We will review key research publications concerning visualverbal communication from relevant disciplines, including professional  technical communication, rhetoric, argumentation, and literacy. Particular attention will be paid to descriptive methods e.g., socialsemiotic analysis, visual argument, and rhetorical structure theory and the types of questions these methods can help us answer.

This repudiation of rhetorical invention fundamentally shaped modern thought and continues to influence the ways we think and communicate today. In this course, we examine the status of rhetorical invention in the development of modern thought and then attend to scholarly efforts to revive a rhetorical understanding of invention from the midtwentieth century forward, surveying contemporary theories of rhetorical invention including those promoted by postmodern, posthuman, and digital rhetorics.

Starting around 1900, photography was practiced with two dominant strands. One of these firmly believed in the power of photographs to provide a window on the world, and was led by Lewis Hine, whose documentary photographs for the National Child Labor Committee helped to ameliorate living and working conditions for thousands of immigrant children. The other strand adhered to the philosophy of Alfred Stieglitz who adamantly affirmed that photographs were first and foremost reflections of the soul and were art objects, equal to painting, drawing and sculpture. These two schools of thought guided photographers throughout the twentieth century. This course explores in depth the tremendous range of photographic expression since World War II and examines in particular the contributions of significant imagemakers such as Helen Levitt, W. Eugene Smith, Robert Frank, Diane Arbus, Garry Winogrand, Charles Teenie Harris, Cindy Sherman, Carrie Mae Weems, Nan Goldin, James Nachtwey, and many others.

Students will learn how to create welldesigned graphs and understand them from a statistical perspective. Furthermore, the course will consider complex data structures that are becoming increasingly common in data visualizations temporal, spatial, and text data we will discuss common ways to process these data that make them easy to visualize. As time permits, we may also consider more advanced graphical methods e.g., interactive graphics and computergenerated animations. In addition to two weekly lectures, there will be weekly computer labs and homework assignments where students use R to visualize and analyze real datasets. Along the way, students also make monthly Piazza posts discussing the strengths and weaknesses of a graph they found online, thereby critiquing real graphical designs found in the wild.

They practice immersing readers within immediate and historical scenes by creating the feel of extended space or elapsed time. Within information writing, students practice presenting readers with new ideas by following the readers native curiosity exposition, guiding readers through manual tasks instruction, and structuring readers decisionmaking argument in controversies when there are multiple decision paths. Argument is a capstone of information writing that bids for social and political change. While writing for experience and writing for information are distinct clusters, they are highly interactive and the best information writers routinely import techniques of experiential writing into their craft to enliven and layer the readers experience.

We look at how grammar is influenced by what people need to do with language, and how discourse affects grammar over time. We ask how children and other language learners learn how to make things happen with talk and writing. We ask how people learn what language is for, from exchanging information to writing poetry to perpetuating systems of belief.

Choices about how to address other people, for example, both create and reflect relationships of power and solidarity.

This course focuses on the scientific problem of analyzing causal hypotheses in realworld settings, not on the mathematical details of regression.  After clearly distinguishing prediction from causation, we discuss how to represent causal hypotheses and how to use regressions to analyze both predictive and causal hypotheses.     Using inclass data exercises throughout, we will examine how to move from an interesting but somewhat vague question about the world e.g., do police discriminate based on race and gender, do NFL athletes choke under high pressure, does parenthood improve happiness to a clear statistical model that, when estimated, meaningfully addresses the question asked.  The course emphasizes causal analysis as the main research goal and multivariate linear regression as the main statistical tool.  After mastering basic techniques, we will introduce students to more advanced econometric approaches such as panel regressions and instrumental variables to deal with trickier settings in which causal inference is more challenging e.g., do more guns lead to more violence.    In keeping with the handson philosophy of the course, a central focus of the semester will be a group research paperpresentation where students will have the opportunity to formulate and empirically test a research question of their choosing.  Students will learn how to find, clean, and analyze a new dataset, and then concisely communicate their findings in the form of a scientific paper and accompanying presentation.
